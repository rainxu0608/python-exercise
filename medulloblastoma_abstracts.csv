24273611,Role of Epidermal Growth Factor-Triggered PI3K/Akt Signaling in the Migration of Medulloblastoma-Derived Cells.,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common brain cancer diagnosed among children. The cellular pathways that regulate MB invasion in response to environmental cues remain incompletely understood. Herein, we examine the migratory response of human MB-derived Daoy cells to different concentration profiles of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) using a microfluidic system. Our findings provide the first quantitative evidence that EGF concentration gradients modulate the chemotaxis of MB-derived cells in a dose-dependent manner ",Veronica V;Richard A RA;Veronica V;Qingjun Q;Maribel M
23864912,Update on molecular and genetic alterations in adult medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma encompasses a group of aggressively growing cancers that arise either in the cerebellum or brain stem. They present primarily in children, with 80-85 % of medulloblastomas being diagnosed in patients of 16 years and younger. In adults, medulloblastomas are rare and account for less than 1 % of intracranial malignancies. Due to the low incidence of medulloblastoma in adults, the biology and genetics of adult medulloblastomas have long been poorly understood. Many centers therefore still treat adults either by radiotherapy only or by using glioblastoma protocols (both often noncurative), or with standard pediatric medulloblastoma regimes (often associated with dose-limiting toxicity).Current clinical staging systems discriminate between standard-risk or high-risk patients based on clinical and histological parameters. However, clinico-pathological features often fail to accurately predict treatment response. In children, molecularly defined risk assessment has become important to improve survival of high-risk patients and to decrease treatment-related toxicity and long-term sequelae in standard-risk patients. However, several recent studies have shown that adult and pediatric medulloblastomas are genetically distinct and may require different algorithms for molecular risk stratification. Moreover, four subtypes of medulloblastoma have been identified that appear at different frequencies in children and adults and that have a different prognostic impact depending on age. Molecular markers such as chromosome 10q and chromosome 17 statuses can be used for molecular risk stratification of adult medulloblastoma, but only in a subgroup-specific context. Here we present an overview of the current knowledge of the genomics of adult medulloblastoma and how these tumors differ from their pediatric counterparts.",Marcel M;Andrey A;Stefan M SM
23691470,Adult medulloblastoma associated with syringomyelia: a case report.,"The association between cerebellar medulloblastoma and syringomyelia is uncommon and only found in pediatric patients. To date, adult medulloblastoma associated with syringomyelia has not been reported in the literature. Paroxysmal bradycardia is an uncommon clinical manifestation in posterior fossa tumors and likely to be vagally mediated via brainstem preganglionic cardiac motor neurons. This report introduces the diagnosis and treatment of a case of adult medulloblastoma associated with syringomyelia, which presented with paroxysmal bradycardia.",Ching-Chun CC
23430850,Onset of adreno-leukodystrophy after medulloblastoma therapy: causal connection or coincidence?,"X-linked adreno-leukodystrophy (ALD) is a peroxisomal disorder affecting the white matter of the central nervous system and the adrenal cortex. It is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene encoding for a peroxisomal membrane protein. The absent genotype-phenotype correlation implies a contribution by environmental factors to explain the phenotypical heterogeneity. We report on a 4-year-old boy with a biochemically confirmed diagnosis of ALD after birth. At the age of 32 months, the additional diagnosis of a medulloblastoma was made. After treatment of the medulloblastoma, he developed active areas of demyelination representing the characteristic neuroimaging features of ALD. The clinical history of our patient supports the hypothesis that external factors, like neurosurgical intervention as part of medulloblastoma treatment, may accelerate or initiate cerebral ALD-related demyelination. A postsurgical inflammatory reaction may facilitate the inclusion of abnormal fatty acids in myelin. The opening of the blood-brain barrier following neurosurgery may enhance the recognition of previously sequestered antigens considered to play a role in ALD onset. Consequently, neurosurgical disruption of the BBB can precipitate the immune-mediated inflammatory process, which progressively destroys myelin in ALD patients. Tumor-related chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy may also play a contributing role. We suggest that X-ALD patients who undergo neurosurgical intervention need close follow-up imaging to identify active demyelination early.",G G;A A;A A;K J KJ;G V GV;M M;T A G M TA

Demographic data, indications and metabolic findings were compared with conventional imaging in 88 adults and children with diverse bone and soft tissue sarcomas as well as 24 gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), 6 pleural malignant mesotheliomas in adults, and 9 medulloblastomas in children. FDG showed good concordance with conventional imaging in NSNE tumors. It was helpful for staging, restaging, follow-up after treatment and for the detection of new not previously suspected lesions. PET with FDG could have a prognostic role and help in patient management, mainly in musculoskeletal and high grade or less differentiated sarcomas. In GIST, it was a good tool for immunotherapy control.",Teresa T;María Josefina MJ;María Paulina MP;José J;Gabriel G;Isabel I;Iván I

With only one exception, all of the prospective clinical trials in this disease have been done in the pediatric population, and therefore therapy for adult medulloblastoma has been either extrapolated from the pediatric literature or based on retrospective reviews. A growing body of literature underscores the genetic similarities between adult and pediatric disease, which may allow tailored therapy directed towards specific molecular pathways and may have an impact on clinical outcomes.

23324231,[Clinicopathologic significance of β-catenin protein and loss of heterozygosity on 10q in medulloblastoma].,"To study the expression of β-catenin protein and the status of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromsome 10q in medulloblastoma, with clinical correlation. Immunohistochemical study for β-catenin protein was carried out in 50 cases of medulloblastoma encountered in the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University during the period from 2002 to 2011, including 32 cases of classic medulloblastoma, 13 cases of desmoplastic medulloblastoma and 5 cases of medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity. The status of LOH on 10q was also detected by fluorescence in-situ hybridization. The clinicopathologic characteristics and prognostic parameters were studied by Kaplan-Meien and Cox analysis. The rates of expression of β-catenin protein in classic medulloblastoma, desmoplastic medulloblastoma and medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity were 53.1% (17/32), 4/13 and 1/5, respectively. The rate of LOH on 10q was 33.3% (8/24) in classic medulloblastoma and 2/11 in desmoplastic medulloblastoma. There was no statistically significant difference between the two tumor types. Univariate analysis showed that the expression of β-catenin protein (P = 0.022), lack of LOH on 10q (P = 0.020), extensiveness of tumor resection (P < 0.01), radiotherapy (P = 0.002) and chemotherapy (P < 0.01) represented important prognostic factors. Medulloblastoma with expression of β-catenin protein and without LOH on 10q carries a better prognosis. Assessment of these parameters is helpful in evaluating prognosis and subsequent patient management.",Jun-zhi JZ;Cheng-hui CH;Fu-an FA;Na N;Gulinaer G;Wei W
23323155,Microscopic Delineation of Medulloblastoma Margins in a Transgenic Mouse Model Using a Topically Applied VEGFR-1 Probe.,"The unambiguous demarcation of tumor margins is critical at the final stages in the surgical treatment of brain tumors because patient outcomes have been shown to correlate with the extent of resection. Real-time high-resolution imaging with the aid of a tumor-targeting fluorescent contrast agent has the potential to enable intraoperative differentiation of tumor versus normal tissues with accuracy approaching the current gold standard of histopathology. In this study, a monoclonal antibody targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) was conjugated to fluorophores and evaluated as a tumor contrast agent in a transgenic mouse model of medulloblastoma. The probe was administered topically, and its efficacy as an imaging agent was evaluated in vitro using flow cytometry, as well as ex vivo on fixed and fresh tissues through immunohistochemistry and dual-axis confocal microscopy, respectively. Results show a preferential binding to tumor versus normal tissue, suggesting that a topically applied VEGFR-1 probe can potentially be used with real-time intraoperative optical sectioning microscopy to guide brain tumor resections.",Danni D;Ye Y;Steven Y SY;Henry H;Christopher H CH;Jonathan T C JT
23319193,Toll-like receptors as an innate immunity bridge to neuroinflammation in medulloblastoma.,"The relationship between inflammation, immunity and cancer is widely accepted but mechanisms mediating this relationship remain unknown. Our present study was undertaken to examine the presence and distribution of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in necrotic areas of medulloblastoma. These receptors fulfil the criteria postulated for the receptors of innate immunity and signalling from TLRs induces synthesis of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, enzymes and mediators. The study was performed on human medulloblastoma samples containing areas of necrosis within the tumour and/or within the normal nerve tissue at the periphery of the tumour. Proteins of four TLRs: TLR 2, 3, 4 and 9 were detected in the tissue with the immunohistochemical method using the specific antibodies. Two types of necrotic areas were found. In the first type, the area of dead cells was surrounded by undifferentiated medulloblastoma cells. A lot of these cells expressed TLR 2 and TLR 3 antigens. TLR 2 was also expressed on the wall of de novo formed blood vessels that fill tumour regions already cleared from dead cells. The second type of necrotic areas were found at the periphery of the tumour and composed of normal nerve tissue cells. TLR 2, TLR 3 and TLR 9 were detected in hypertrophic glia cells. Our findings show a new function of TLRs as sensors of pathogens released by medulloblastoma dead cells. This new function may provide a key link connecting innate immunity, neuroinflammation and angiogenesis in the tumour.",Danuta D;Milena M;Slawomir S
23316474,Radiation therapy quality in CCG/POG intergroup 9961: implications for craniospinal irradiation and the posterior fossa boost in future medulloblastoma trials.,"Associations of radiation therapy (RT) deviations and outcomes in medulloblastoma have not been defined well, particularly in the era of reduced-dose craniospinal irradiation and chemotherapy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of RT on Children's Cancer Group/Pediatric Oncology Group 9961 and analyze associations of RT deviations with outcome. Major volume deviations were assessed based on the distance from specified anatomical region to field edge. We investigated associations of RT deviations with progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and explored associations with demographics and clinical variables. Of the 308 patients who were evaluable for volume deviations, 101 patients (33%) did not have any. Of the remaining 207 patients, 50% had only minor deviations, 29% had only major deviations, and 21% had both minor and major deviations. Of the patients with major deviations, 73% had a single major deviation. The most common major deviation was in the cribriform plate region, followed by the posterior fossa (PF); PF deviations resulted from treating less than whole PF. There were no significant differences in PFS or OS between patients with deviations and those without. There was no evidence of associations of deviations with patient age. Approximately one-third of patients had major volume deviations. There was no evidence of a significant association between these and outcome. This lack of correlation likely reflects the current high quality of RT delivered in Children's Oncology Group institutions, our strict definition of volume deviations, and the relatively few instances of multiple major deviations in individual patients. In is noteworthy that the types of PF volume deviations observed in this study were not adversely associated with outcome. As we move forward, quality assurance will continue to play an important role to ensure that deviations on study do not influence study outcome.",Bernadine B;Mary A H MA;Sandra S;Matthew K MK;Thomas T;Emiko E;Mehmet M;James M JM;Amar A;Roger J RJ
23285547,A visual latent semantic approach for automatic analysis and interpretation of anaplastic medulloblastoma virtual slides.,"A method for automatic analysis and interpretation of histopathology images is presented. The method uses a representation of the image data set based on bag of features histograms built from visual dictionary of Haar-based patches and a novel visual latent semantic strategy for characterizing the visual content of a set of images. One important contribution of the method is the provision of an interpretability layer, which is able to explain a particular classification by visually mapping the most important visual patterns associated with such classification. The method was evaluated on a challenging problem involving automated discrimination of medulloblastoma tumors based on image derived attributes from whole slide images as anaplastic or non-anaplastic. The data set comprised 10 labeled histopathological patient studies, 5 for anaplastic and 5 for non-anaplastic, where 750 square images cropped randomly from cancerous region from whole slide per study. The experimental results show that the new method is competitive in terms of classification accuracy achieving 0.87 in average.",Angel A;Fabio F;Joseph J;Alexander R AR;David D;Jennifer J;Anant A;Eduardo E
23281136,Malnutrition in pediatric patients with cancer at diagnosis and throughout therapy: A multicenter cohort study.,"Malnutrition is a common problem in pediatric patients with cancer. Reported prevalence varies widely and has often been assessed only in a subset of childhood types of cancer. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of malnutrition among pediatric patients newly diagnosed with cancer, to describe the occurrence and course of malnutrition during therapy and to identify factors associated with malnutrition during therapy. In a retrospective cohort study of 327 patients diagnosed from 2003 to 2006 in three Swiss tertiary care hospitals, weight and height measures together with patient-, disease-, and treatment-related characteristics were assessed. Malnutrition was defined as body mass index (BMI) below -2 standard deviation scores (SDS) or a weight loss >10% from diagnosis. Malnutrition was assessed at diagnosis and continuously during anticancer therapy. At diagnosis, 5.8% of the patients (19) were malnourished based on BMI. During anticancer therapy, the cumulative incidence of malnutrition rose to 22% (70 patients) after 30 days, to 36% (116 patients) after 60 days, and finally to 47% (155 patients). In these 155 patients, the median duration of malnutrition was 60 days (interquartile range, 21-122). Age above 10 years at diagnosis, BMI ≤ -1.0 SDS at diagnosis, and a diagnosis of medulloblastoma were positively associated with a higher proportion of malnutrition time during therapy. The rapid increase of malnutrition after the start of treatment underlines the need to develop evidence-based and efficient methods to provide nutritional support for children with cancer.",Karin K;Roland A RA;Claudia E CE;Sabina S;Eva E
23273960,Differentiation between high and low grade tumours in paediatric patients by using apparent diffusion coefficients.,"This study was performed to confirm the hypothesis that pre-operative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) can be used to distinguish between ""low grade"" and ""high grade"" tumours in paediatric patients. ADC values were retrospectively evaluated in thirty-six paediatric brain tumours. Twenty-one children with low grade brain tumours (12 WHO I astrocytomas, 1 giant cell tumour, 1 pilomyxoid astrocytoma, 4 WHO II astrocytomas, 2 craniopharyngiomas and 1 ganglioglioma) and 15 children with high grade brain tumours (6 medulloblastomas, 3 WHO III ependymomas, 1 PNET, 1 malignant rhabdoid tumour, 1 malignant germ cell tumour, 1 WHO III astrocytoma, 1 WHO IV astrocytoma, 1 rhabdomyosarcoma metastasis) were included in this study. Minimum and mean ADC values were compared between low grade and high grade tumours and cut-off values were evaluated. The cut-off values to differentiate low and high grade paediatric brain tumours were 0.7 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s and 1.0 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s for minimum ADC and average ADC values respectively. All but one high grade infratentorial ependymoma showed significantly lower ADC values than low grade brain tumours in children. Combining the information obtained from conventional MR imaging with the ADC values may increase the accuracy of pre-operative differentiation between low grade and high grade paediatric tumours. Cut-off values can help to discern low from high grade tumours. However, it has to be considered that there is a substantial overlap between tumour types previously described in the literature.",Luciana L;Alina A;Dirk D;Matthias M;Elke E

23258845,Reduced-dose craniospinal radiotherapy followed by tandem high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with high-risk medulloblastoma.,"We assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of reduced-dose craniospinal (CS) radiotherapy (RT) followed by tandem high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDCT/autoSCT) in reducing late adverse effects without jeopardizing survival among children with high-risk medulloblastoma (MB). From October 2005 through September 2010, twenty consecutive children aged >3 years with high-risk MB (presence of metastasis and/or postoperative residual tumor >1.5 cm(2)) were assigned to receive 2 cycles of pre-RT chemotherapy, CSRT (23.4 or 30.6 Gy) combined with local RT to the primary site (total 54.0 Gy), and 4 cycles of post-RT chemotherapy followed by tandem HDCT/autoSCT. Carboplatin-thiotepa-etoposide and cyclophosphamide-melphalan regimens were used for the first and second HDCT, respectively. Of 20 patients with high-risk MB, 17 had metastatic disease and 3 had a postoperative residual tumor >1.5 cm(2) without metastasis. The tumor relapsed/progressed in 4 patients, and 2 patients died of toxicities during the second HDCT/autoSCT. Therefore, 14 patients remained event-free at a median follow-up of 46 months (range, 23-82) from diagnosis. The probability of 5-year event-free survival was 70.0% ± 10.3% for all patients and 70.6% ± 11.1% for patients with metastases. Late adverse effects evaluated at a median of 36 months (range, 12-68) after tandem HDCT/autoSCT were acceptable. In children with high-risk MB, CSRT dose might be reduced when accompanied by tandem HDCT/autoSCT without jeopardizing survival. However, longer follow-up is needed to evaluate whether the benefits of reduced-dose CSRT outweigh the long-term risks of tandem HDCT/autoSCT.",Ki Woong KW;Do Hoon DH;Meong Hi MH;Soo Hyun SH;Keon Hee KH;Hong Hoe HH;Ji Hye JH;Yeon-Lim YL;Yoo Sook YS;Hyung Jin HJ

For those with high-grade gliomas (HGGs) including diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, 5-year survival remains <10%. Sixty-five percent patients with ependymoma are cured after surgery and radiation therapy depending on the degree of resection and histopathology of the tumor. Phase II trials for brain tumors will investigate agents that act on cMET, PDGFRA, or EZH2 in HGG, DIPG, or medulloblastoma, respectively.

23251668,In vitro comparison of hypericin and 5-aminolevulinic acid-derived protoporphyrin IX for photodynamic inactivation of medulloblastoma cells.,"Hypericin (HYP) is a naturally occurring photosensitizer. Cellular uptake and photodynamic inactivation after incubation with this photosensitizer have neither been examined in medulloblastoma cells in vitro, nor compared with 5-aminolevulinic acid-derived protoporphyrin IX (5-ALA-derived PpIX). In 3 medulloblastoma cell lines (D283 Med, Daoy, and D341 Med) the time- and concentration-dependent intracellular accumulation of HYP and 5-ALA-derived PpIX was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (FM) and FACS. Photocytotoxicity was measured after illumination at 595 nm (HYP) and 635 nm (5-ALA-derived PpIX) in D283 Med cells and compared to U373 MG glioma cells. All medulloblastoma cell lines exhibited concentration- and time-dependent uptake of HYP. Incubation with HYP up to 10 µM resulted in a rapid increase in fluorescence intensity, which peaked between 2 and 4 hours. 5-ALA-derived PpIX accumulation increased in D283 Med cells by 22% over baseline after 5-ALA incubation up to 1.2 mM. Photocytotoxicity of 5-ALA-derived PpIX was higher in D283 Med medulloblastoma compared to U373MG glioma. The LD50 [lethal dose (light dose that is required to reduce cell survival to 50% of control)] of 5-ALA-derived PpIX was 3.8 J/cm(2) in D283 Med cells versus 5.7 J/cm2 in U373MG glioma cells. Photocytotoxicity of HYP in D283 Med cells was determined at 2.5 µM after an incubation time of 2 h and an illumination wavelength of 595 nm. The [Formula: see text] value was 0.47 J/cm(2). By its 5-fold increase in fluorescence over autofluorescence levels HYP has excellent properties for tumor visualization in medulloblastomas. The high photocytotoxicity of HYP, compared to 5-ALA-derived PpIX, is convincingly demonstrated by its 8- to 13-fold lower LD50. Therefore HYP might be a promising molecule for intraoperative visualization and photodynamic treatment of medulloblastomas.",Rainer R;Christian C;Susan S;Florian F;Martin M;Klaus K;Wolfgang S L WS
23250910,MiR-124 targets Slug to regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis of breast cancer.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miR) have been integrated into tumorigenic programs as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. The miR-124 was reported to be attenuated in several tumors, such as glioma, medulloblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its role in cancer remains greatly elusive. In this study, we show that the miR-124 expression is significantly suppressed in human breast cancer specimens, which is reversely correlated to histological grade of the cancer. More intriguingly, ectopic expression of miR-124 in aggressive breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 strongly inhibits cell motility and invasive capacity, as well as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. Also, lentivirus-delivered miR-124 endows MDA-MB-231 cells with the ability to suppress cell colony formation in vitro and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. Further studies have identified the E-cadherin transcription repressor Slug as a direct target gene of miR-124; its downregulation by miR-124 increases the expression of E-cadherin, a hallmark of epithelial cells and a repressor of cell invasion and metastasis. Moreover, knockdown of Slug notably impairs the motility of MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas re-expression of Slug abrogates the reduction of motility and invasion ability induced by miR-124 in MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings highlight an important role for miR-124 in the regulation of invasive and metastatic potential of breast cancer and suggest a potential application of miR-124 in cancer treatment.",Yong-Jun YJ;Qiu-Yu QY;Ci-Xiang CX;Qian-Qian QQ;Ming M;Xiao-Ting XT;Dan-Xia DX;Guo-Qiang GQ;Jian-Rong JR;Qian Q

23245832,Medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastomas are primary malignant embryonal tumours of the central nervous system. They are the most common childhood central nervous system tumour, but are rare in the adult population. They arise infratentorially in the cerebellum or fourth ventricle and hence the most common presenting symptoms are those associated with raised intracranial pressure. Several histological subtypes have been described, although the classical and desmoplastic subtypes account for the majority. Recent advances in molecular biology and cytogenetics have led to an improved understanding of the genetic abnormalities and alterations in cell signalling pathways associated with medulloblastomas, including how these relate to patient outcome. The Modified Chang Staging System is still in use, but a number of other factors, including age, completeness of resection, histological subtype and genetic markers now contribute to treatment decisions and prognostication. Patients are currently classified as being either standard or high risk in order to stratify treatment. There has been an improvement in survival of all groups over the past 20 years. A multimodality approach is the cornerstone of treatment and recent trials have concentrated on ascertaining the most efficacious treatment combinations and timings for each patient group. Advances in surgical techniques have allowed a greater attainment of the two primary surgical goals: restoring normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow and maximal tumour resection. Radiotherapy to the craniospinal axis with a boost to the posterior fossa has been standard practice, but improvement in radiotherapy techniques and quality control has enabled optimisation of the trade-off between tumour control and normal tissue late toxicities. Combination chemotherapy is usually given adjuvantly, although it may be used to delay or avoid the use of radiotherapy in infants. In the future, the treatment of medulloblastoma will probably become increasingly individualised, based on patient-specific genetic features. Attention will be focussed not only on improving survival, but also on maintaining quality of life.",F F;R R;F F
23242569,Survivin expression in medulloblastoma: a possible marker for survival.,"Medulloblastomas are highly invasive tumors which are generally disseminated at the time of diagnosis. High and continued morbidity and mortality have prompted the search for new biologic markers that might be used for targeted therapy to minimise treatment related side effects. In this work, we studied the positive expression of survivin in medulloblastoma and investigated its relation to clinical, pathologic data and survival. Tumor tissue specimens from 47 patients with medulloblastoma who underwent primary surgical treatment from June 2002 to June 2006 at the Mansoura university hospital, Egypt were collected. Paraffin sections of all samples were submitted for immunohistochemistry using anti-survivin antibody. The relation between the percentage of positive survivin cells with clinical, pathological and survival data was evaluated. In 47 cancer tissue specimens, one case large-cell-anaplastic (1.12 %), tweleve cases desmoplastic (25.53 %) and 34 cases classic medulloblastomas (72.34 %). The immunohistochemical expression of survivin was nulear with moderate intensity. It does not correlate with either age or sex. There was a significant negative correlation of survivin expression with survival (p < 0.001), where negative survivin immunostaining was associated with prolonged overall and disease free survival, while survivin expression was associated with shortened survival. Survivin expression correlate with the clinical outcome with poor prognosis and could be a potential predictive factor for recurrence or metastasis.",Azza A;Mie Ali Ali MA;Fatma Mohamed Farouk FM;Ahmed Nageeb M AN
23237957,Constitutive activation of β-catenin in neural progenitors results in disrupted proliferation and migration of neurons within the central nervous system.,"Wnt signaling is known to play crucial roles in the development of multiple organs as well as in cancer. In particular, constitutive activation of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling in distinct populations of forebrain or brainstem precursor cells has previously been shown to result in dramatic brain enlargement during embryonic stages of development as well as in the formation of medulloblastoma, a malignant brain tumor in childhood. In order to extend this knowledge to postnatal stages of both cerebral and cerebellar cortex development, we conditionally activated Wnt signaling by introducing a dominant active form of β-catenin in hGFAP-positive neural precursors. Such mutant mice survived up to 21 days postnatally. While the mice revealed enlarged ventricles and an initial expansion of the Pax6-positive ventricular zone, Pax6 expression and proliferative activity in the ventricular zone was virtually lost by embryonic day 16.5. Loss of Pax6 expression was not followed by expression of the subventricular zone marker Tbr2, indicating insufficient neuronal differentiation. In support of this finding, cortical thickness was severely diminished in all analyzed stages from embryonic day 14.5 to postnatal day 12, and appropriate layering was not detectable. Similarly, cerebella of hGFAP-cre::Ctnnb1(ex3)(Fl/+) mice were hypoplastic and displayed severe lamination defects. Constitutively active β-Catenin induced inappropriate proliferation of granule neurons and inadequate development of Bergmann glia, thereby preventing regular migration of granule cells and normal cortical layering. We conclude that Wnt signaling has divergent roles in the central nervous system and that Wnt needs to be tightly controlled in a time- and cell type-specific manner.",Julia J;Daniel D;Mario M MM;Hans A HA;Ulrich U

23233213,Survival of children with malignant brain tumors receiving valproate: a retrospective study.,"The treatment of pediatric patients with malignant brain tumors has evolved considerably in the past decades. However, results are still unsatisfactory for some patients. Valproate has been shown to positively affect the survival of adult glioblastoma patients. We have been giving prophylactic antiepileptic drugs to newly diagnosed children with brain tumors. Since then, we noted a trend towards a better survival from our patients. In order to study this, we performed a retrospective evaluation in our institution. Standard survival analysis was used, calculating survival until death by all causes or censoring. Comparisons were made by Cox's proportional hazards model regression. Between 2000 and 2010, 94 patients were treated (12 with high-grade gliomas, 56 medulloblastomas, and 26 ependymomas); median and mean ages were 7.7 and 7.8 years. Median follow-up was 60 months (35 for treated and 109 for untreated patients). Of these, 47 received valproate 10-15 mg/kg/day every 8-12 h and 47 did not. Patients who received valproate had a median survival of 34 months, whereas the other group had a median survival of 24 months (hazard ratios = 0.99, 0.57-1.75, p = 0.99). These results do not prove that valproate prophylactic treatment in pediatric patients with malignant brain tumors had an influence on their survival. However, our cohort showed an effect of higher size than the recent European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer trial analysis, even though not significant. Clinical trials with valproate in pediatric malignant brain tumors should be carefully planned, in order to detect a possible effect of this drug in survival.",F H C FH;O L OL;K M KM;N M NM;J B JB
23231521,Medulloblastoma biology in the post-genomic era.,"Medulloblastomas, the most common malignant pediatric brain tumors, are comprised of four molecularly distinct subtypes. However, treatment has yet to exploit these molecular vulnerabilities. Three recent studies sequenced a total of 310 primary tumors and identified that two of the four medulloblastoma subtypes are concomitantly associated with subtype-specific mutations as previously characterized. In contrast, the overwhelming majority of mutations occurred only once in the entire cohort and just 12 genes were recurrently mutated with statistical significance. Perturbations in epigenetic regulation are emerging as a unifying theme in cancer and similarly recurring mutations in epigenetic mechanisms were distributed across all subtypes in medulloblastoma. Designing targeted therapies to such a molecularly diverse disease in the post-genomic era presents new challenges. This will require novel methods to link these nonrecurrent mutations into pathways, and preclinical models that faithfully recapitulate patient driver events. Presently, medulloblastoma reinforces epigenetic mechanisms as a tantalizing therapeutic target in cancers.",Tenley C TC;Scott L SL
23222297,Twenty-fourth annual Pezcoller symposium: Molecular basis for resistance to targeted agents.,"The mechanisms of genetically determined mechanisms of resistance to several target drugs were discussed in breast cancer, melanoma, colorectal and prostate cancers, chronic myelogenous leukemia, small cell lung cancer, and medulloblastoma. In each case, heterogeneity of mechanisms was emphasized. In melanoma, therapeutic interference with the effects of BRAF mutations was repeatedly discussed. It was also reported that anti-CTLA4 antibodies provided the first treatment improving survival of patients with stage IV melanoma. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was introduced as a mechanism of resistance, particularly in lung and pancreatic cancer, where the role of microenvironment factors was also indicated. In colorectal and prostate cancers, the use of liquid biopsies, namely, measurements of tumor nucleic acid in blood, were indicated as a way to obtain whole-tumor assessment instead of the partial assessment obtainable with traditional biopsies. Knowledge of the mechanisms of drug action and resistance was stressed to be essential for the design of new agents and combination of agents aimed at increasing antitumor effectiveness and overcoming resistance.",Richard R;William W;David D;Enrico E
23222069,[Chromatin remodeling defects and cancer: the SWI/SNF example].,"The SWI/SNF complex is a multiprotein complex essential for chromatin remodelling. As such, it plays a key role in the epigenetic regulation of genome expression. This complex is composed of a dozen of proteins, some of which are constant and ubiquitous, especially SMARCB1 and SMARCA4. Mutations in these genes are now described in an increasing number of tumors. Mutations in SMARCB1 characterize the majority of rhabdoid tumors, an aggressive malignancy that exquisitely depends on this single genetic event. Rare rhabdoid tumors have mutation in SMARCA4, a genetic abnormality also found in some medulloblastomas. Many other tumor types, of variable aggressiveness, show an abnormal loss of expression of SMARCB1, but the genetic underlying cause most often remains elusive. The recent sequencings of whole exomes have described frequent mutations in other genes of the SWI/SNF complex: mutations in ARID1A in liver, gastric or bladder carcinomas, and PBRM1 mutations in renal cancers. These data establish the wide role of SWI/SNF complex in cancers and justify that major efforts should now be devoted to this common mechanism of human oncogenesis.",Franck F;Ivan I
23212916,MicroRNA 218 acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting multiple cancer phenotype-associated genes in medulloblastoma.,"Aberrant expression of microRNAs has been implicated in many cancers. We recently demonstrated differential expression of several microRNAs in medulloblastoma. In this study, the regulation and function of microRNA 218 (miR-218), which is significantly underexpressed in medulloblastoma, was evaluated. Re-expression of miR-218 resulted in a significant decrease in medulloblastoma cell growth, cell colony formation, cell migration, invasion, and tumor sphere size. We used C17.2 neural stem cells as a model to show that increased miR-218 expression results in increased cell differentiation and also decreased malignant transformation when transfected with the oncogene REST. These results suggest that miR-218 acts as a tumor suppressor in medulloblastoma. MicroRNAs function by down-regulating translation of target mRNAs. Targets are determined by imperfect base pairing of the microRNA to the 3'-UTR of the mRNA. To comprehensively identify actual miR-218 targets, medulloblastoma cells overexpressing miR-218 and control cells were subjected to high throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation, a technique that identifies the mRNAs bound to the RNA-induced silencing complex component protein Argonaute 2. High throughput sequencing of mRNAs identified 618 genes as targets of miR-218 and included both previously validated targets and many targets not predicted computationally. Additional work further confirmed CDK6, RICTOR, and CTSB (cathepsin B) as targets of miR-218 and examined the functional role of one of these targets, CDK6, in medulloblastoma.",Sujatha S;Diane K DK;Ilango I;Irina I;Peter S PS;Purvi R PR;Michael H MH;Adrian A;Michael D MD;Nicholas K NK;Rajeev R
23211539,Progress from clinical trials and emerging non-conventional therapies for the treatment of Medulloblastomas.,"Medulloblastomas are highly aggressive tumors of the cerebellum with an embryonal origin. Despite current treatment modalities which include a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation, challenges still exist to effectively treat some patients, especially those within the younger age group. In an effort to find improved therapies, ongoing research led by world-wide teams have explored non-conventional therapeutic strategies, as well as examined the efficacy of several drugs in clinical trials among patients with Medulloblastomas. We outline in this article, recent advances on the efficacy and toxicity of numerous therapeutic agents including those that are DNA damaging agents, microtubules binding compounds, and those that are inhibitors of Topoisomerase and of the Notch and Hedgehog signaling pathway, which were assessed in recent Phase I and II clinical trials. Among these clinical trials, it is unfortunate that the outcomes were dismal with the majority of the patients with Medulloblastomas still succumbing to relapse after conventional therapies. Furthermore, it is yet to be established clearly the clinical efficacy of non-conventional therapies such as immunotherapy and gene therapy. Moreover, there is growing interest in proton therapy as a potential replacement for photon therapy, while high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue may improve therapeutic efficacies. However, further research is needed to resolve the inherent toxicity from these novel therapeutic methods. In conclusion, novel therapies based on a better understanding of the biology of Medulloblastomas are pivotal in improving non-conventional therapies in the treatment of this deadly disease.",Norbert Fonya NF;Hao Yang HY;Deepak D
23205122,Redox status expressed as GSH:GSSG ratio as a marker for oxidative stress in paediatric tumour patients.,"Oxidative stress causes profound alterations of various biological structures, including cellular membranes, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids, and it is involved in numerous malignancies. Reduced glutathione (GSH) is considered to be one of the most important scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and its ratio with oxidised glutathione (GSSG) may be used as a marker of oxidative stress. The main aim of this study was to determine GSH:GSSG ratio in the blood serum of paediatric cancer patients to use this ratio as a potential marker of oxidative stress. The whole procedure was optimised and the recoveries for both substances were greater than 80% under the optimised conditions. We analysed a group of paediatric patients (n=116) with various types of cancer, including neuroblastoma, anaplastic ependymoma, germ cell tumour, genital tract tumour, lymphadenopathy, rhabdomyosarcoma, nephroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, medulloblastoma and retinoblastoma. We simultaneously determined the levels of reduced and oxidised glutathione, and thus, its ratio in the blood serum of the patients. The highest ratio was observed in retinoblastoma patients and the lowest in anaplastic ependymoma. We were able to distinguish between the diagnoses based on the results of the obtained GSH:GSSG ratio.",Ondrej O;Sylvie S;Jaromir J;Michal M;Vojtech V;Jaromir J;Libuse L;Jarmila J;Tomas T;Rene R
23194364,Achieving graft-versus-tumor effect in brain tumor patients: from autologous progenitor cell transplant to active immunotherapy.,"Success in treating aggressive brain tumors like glioblastoma multiforme and medulloblastoma remains challenging, in part because these malignancies overcome CNS immune surveillance. New insights into brain tumor immunology have led to a rational development of immunotherapeutic strategies, including cytotoxic Tlymphocyte therapies and dendritic cell vaccines. However, these therapies are most effective when applied in a setting of minimal residual disease, so require prior use of standard cytotoxic therapies or cytoreduction by surgery. Myeloablative chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autoHCT) can offer a platform upon which different cellular therapies can be effectively instituted. Specifically, this approach provides an inherent 'chemical debulking' through high-dose chemotherapy and a graft-versus-tumor effect through an autologous T-cell replete graft. Furthermore, autoHCT may be beneficial in 'resetting' the body's immune system, potentially 'breaking' tumor tolerance, and in providing a 'boost' of immune effector cells (NK cells or cytotoxic T lymphocytes), which could augment desired anti-tumor effects. As literature on the use of autoHCT in brain tumors is scarce, aspects of immunotherapies applied in non-CNS malignancies are reviewed as potential therapies that could be used in conjunction with autoHCT to eradicate brain tumors.",Agne A;Jeffery J JJ;Hillard M HM
23190500,Inhibition of EZH2 suppresses self-renewal and induces radiation sensitivity in atypical rhabdoid teratoid tumor cells.,"Overexpression of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) subunit Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2) occurs in several malignancies, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, medulloblastoma, and glioblastoma multiforme. Recent evidence suggests that EZH2 may also have a role in rhabdoid tumors. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is a rare, high-grade embryonal brain tumor that occurs most commonly in young children and carries a very poor prognosis. ATRTs are characterized by absence of the chromatin remodeling protein SMARCB1. Given the role of EZH2 in regulating epigenetic changes, we investigated the role of EZH2 in ATRT. Microarray analysis was used to evaluate expression of EZH2 in ATRT tumor samples. We used shRNA and a chemical inhibitor of EZH2 to examine the impact of EZH2 inhibition on cell growth, proliferation, and tumor cell self-renewal. Here, we show that targeted disruption of EZH2 by RNAi or pharmacologic inhibition strongly impairs ATRT cell growth, suppresses tumor cell self-renewal, induces apoptosis, and potently sensitizes these cells to radiation. Using functional analysis of transcription factor activity, we found the cyclin D1-E2F axis to be repressed after EZH2 depletion in ATRT cells. Our observations provide evidence that EZH2 disruption alters cell cycle progression and may be an important new therapeutic target, particularly in combination with radiation, in ATRT.",Irina I;Diane K DK;Peter S PS;Jeffrey A JA;Sujatha S;Victor E VE;Nicholas K NK;Rajeev R
23184418,Aberrant patterns of H3K4 and H3K27 histone lysine methylation occur across subgroups in medulloblastoma.,"Recent sequencing efforts have described the mutational landscape of the pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma. Although MLL2 is among the most frequent somatic single nucleotide variants (SNV), the clinical and biological significance of these mutations remains uncharacterized. Through targeted re-sequencing, we identified mutations of MLL2 in 8 % (14/175) of MBs, the majority of which were loss of function. Notably, we also report mutations affecting the MLL2-binding partner KDM6A, in 4 % (7/175) of tumors. While MLL2 mutations were independent of age, gender, histological subtype, M-stage or molecular subgroup, KDM6A mutations were most commonly identified in Group 4 MBs, and were mutually exclusive with MLL2 mutations. Immunohistochemical staining for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, the chromatin effectors of MLL2 and KDM6A activity, respectively, demonstrated alterations of the histone code in 24 % (53/220) of MBs across all subgroups. Correlating these MLL2- and KDM6A-driven histone marks with prognosis, we identified populations of MB with improved (K4+/K27-) and dismal (K4-/K27-) outcomes, observed primarily within Group 3 and 4 MBs. Group 3 and 4 MBs demonstrate somatic copy number aberrations, and transcriptional profiles that converge on modifiers of H3K27-methylation (EZH2, KDM6A, KDM6B), leading to silencing of PRC2-target genes. As PRC2-mediated aberrant methylation of H3K27 has recently been targeted for therapy in other diseases, it represents an actionable target for a substantial percentage of medulloblastoma patients with aggressive forms of the disease.",Adrian M AM;Marc M;Andrey A;Paul A PA;Shing H SH;Maria M;Marcel M;David T W DT;Alexander A;A Sorana AS;David D;John J;Vijay V;Adi A;Xin X;Hendrik H;Thomas T;Cynthia C;Rajeev R;Sidney S;James T JT;William A WA;Steven J M SJ;Charles G CG;Marco A MA;Stefan M SM;Michael D MD
23184224,Fronto-cerebellar fiber tractography in pediatric patients following posterior fossa tumor surgery.,"Fronto-cerebellar association fibers (FCF) are involved in neurocognitive regulatory circuitry. This may also be relevant for cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) as a complication following posterior fossa tumor removal in children. In the present study, we investigated FCF by diffusion tensor imaging in affected children and controls. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging at 3 T (GE) allowed tractography of FCF using a fiber tracking algorithm software (Brainlab 2.6) in 29 patients after posterior fossa tumor removal and in 10 healthy peers. Fiber tract volumes were assessed and fiber signals were evaluated in a semiquantitative manner along the anatomical course. Volumes of FCF revealed significant diminished values in pediatric patients with symptoms of CMS (19.3 ± 11.7 cm(3)) when compared with patients without symptoms of CMS (26.9 ± 11.9 cm(3)) and with healthy peers (36.5 ± 13.82 cm(3)). In medulloblastoma patients, the volume of FCF was also significantly reduced in patients with symptoms of CMS despite having the same antitumor therapy. In semiquantitative analysis of the fiber tract signals, differences were observed in the superior cerebellar peduncles and midline cerebellar structures in patients with symptoms of CMS. Using DTI, which allows the visualization of fronto-cerebellar fiber tracts, lower FCF tract volumes and diminished fiber signal intensities at the level of the superior cerebellar peduncles and in midline cerebellar structures were identified in patients with postoperative symptoms of CMS. Our study refers to the role of a neural circuitry between frontal lobes and the cerebellum being involved in neurocognitive impairment after posterior fossa tumor treatment in children.",Verena V;Pablo P;Alexander A;Stefan S;Harald H;Wilhelm W;Ulrich-Wilhelm UW

23182688,Treatment of adult nonmetastatic medulloblastoma patients according to the paediatric HIT 2000 protocol: a prospective observational multicentre study.,"Medulloblastoma in adulthood is rare. Knowledge is limited, and the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy--especially in nonmetastatic disease--is still elusive. Seventy adults aged ≥21 years (median age: 28.5 years) with nonmetastatic medulloblastoma were followed as observational patients within the prospective paediatric multicentre trial HIT 2000. Treatment consisted of radiotherapy (35.2 Gy to the craniospinal axis and a boost to 55.2 Gy to the posterior fossa) followed in most patients by maintenance chemotherapy (lomustine (CCNU), vincristine and cisplatin, n=49). The implementation of maintenance chemotherapy was feasible. Peripheral neuropathy (74%) and haematotoxicity (55%) during maintenance chemotherapy appear to be more common in adults than in children. At a median follow-up of 3.7 years, the 4-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates±standard error (SE) were 68%±7% and 89%±5%. Patients with desmoplastic medulloblastoma and lateral tumour location (n=19) had a lower EFS compared to patients with centrally located desmoplastic tumours (n=10) (p=0.011). Absence of residual postoperative tumour (n=40) was associated to a lower rate of progression/relapse compared to present (n=11) or unknown (n=12) residual tumour status (p=0.006). Lateral tumour location and unknown residual tumour status were independent negative prognostic factors. Maintenance chemotherapy is applicable in adults with nonmetastatic medulloblastoma. Histological subtype and tumour location were newly identified risk factors in this age-group, and should be further analysed in prospective trials.",Carsten C;André O AO;Katja K;Robert R;Torsten T;Monika M;Peter P;Frank F;Joachim J;Rolf D RD;Stefan S
23179395,From small to big: microRNAs as new players in medulloblastomas.,"Medulloblastomas (MB) are the most common malignant neoplasms of the central nervous system in children. Although the molecular basis of medulloblastoma has received considerable attention over the past decade, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of medulloblastoma initiation, maintenance, and progression remain unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that function as key regulators of diverse biological processes by exerting negative gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level. Emerging evidence indicates that miRNAs play an important role in the development of human cancers; miRNA deregulation results in altered activities of downstream tumor suppressors, oncogenes, and other signaling molecules. In this review, we comprehensively discuss the versatile roles of miRNAs in medulloblastoma and their potential applications in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of this malignancy. As a rapidly evolving field of basic and biomedical sciences, miRNA research will certainly have a revolutionary impact on the management of medulloblastoma.",Feng F;Suinuan S;Rong R;Xiwei X;Yilin Y
23179372,OTX2 sustains a bivalent-like state of OTX2-bound promoters in medulloblastoma by maintaining their H3K27me3 levels.,"Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases. Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425 medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2, EED, SUZ12 and RBBP4 and upregulation of H3K27 demethylases KDM6A, KDM6B, JARID2 and KDM7A. This was accompanied by decreased H3K27me3 and increased H3K27me1 levels in promoter regions. Strikingly, the decrease of H3K27me3 was most prominent in promoters that bind OTX2. OTX2-bound promoters showed high levels of the H3K4me3 and H3K9ac activation marks and intermediate levels of the H3K27me3 inactivation mark, reminiscent of a bivalent modification. After silencing of OTX2, H3K27me3 levels strongly dropped, but H3K4me3 and H3K9ac levels remained high. OTX2-bound bivalent genes showed high expression levels in D425, but the expression of most of these genes did not change after OTX2 silencing and loss of the H3K27me3 mark. Maintaining promoters in a bivalent state by sustaining H3K27 trimethylation therefore seems to be an important function of OTX2 in medulloblastoma, while other transcription factors might regulate the actual expression levels of these genes.",Jens J;Nancy A NA;Danny A DA;Jan J;Rogier R;Marcel M

Identifying the cells from which a tumor arises can facilitate the development of animal models and point to novel targets for therapy. Medulloblastoma is an aggressive tumor of the cerebellum that occurs predominantly in children. Recent genomic studies suggest that medulloblastoma consists of 4 major subgroups, each with distinct mutations and signaling pathway deregulations, and each potentially arising from distinct populations of stem cells and progenitors. Here we review the major types of progenitor cells in the cerebellum and discuss their role in the genesis of medulloblastoma.",Jun J;Robert J RJ
23178199,Changes in the patterns of care of central nervous system tumours among 16-24 year olds and the effect on survival in Yorkshire between 1990 and 2009.,"There is a paucity of work documenting the influence of patterns of care on survival for teenagers and young adults with primary central nervous system tumours. Therefore, the aim of this study was to undertake a detailed assessment examining any changes in the patterns of care over time and how these related to survival outcomes for 16-24 year olds diagnosed with a primary central nervous system tumour between 1990 and 2009. We used high-quality data from one population-based cancer registry in Yorkshire, UK to describe primary central nervous system tumours in teenagers and young adults (16-24 years) diagnosed between 1990 and 2009. The Birch classification scheme was used to identify differences by tumour subgroup. Incidence, patterns of care and survival trends were described using Poisson and Cox regression. There were 163 cases comprising 98 astrocytomas, 17 'other gliomas', 14 ependymomas, 11 medulloblastomas and 23 'other intracranial and intraspinal neoplasms' yielding an overall incidence of 18.1 million person-years. Care varied significantly over time and by principal treatment centre (Leeds 77%, Hull 23%), co-ordinating specialty (neurosurgery 53%, clinical oncology 22%, paediatrics 17%, other adult services 8%) and treatment received. Cox regression showed no significant difference in survival by age, gender, treatment centre, level of deprivation, year of diagnosis or co-ordinating specialty, but a significant difference by tumour grade and diagnostic group. Survival improved for all diagnostic groups except astrocytoma, although only the medulloblastoma group showed a significant change over time. The lack of any significant improvement in survival over time in most diagnostic groups warrants further investigation and provides justification for a more collaborative regional approach to the care of central nervous system tumours, perhaps through the development of regional guidelines for this unique population. More detailed analysis of relapse patterns and prediagnostic symptoms would also be informative for this cohort.",B D BD;S V SV;P P;S S;M M;C C;G G;D P DP;R G RG

23172372,Expression of miR-124 inhibits growth of medulloblastoma cells.,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children, and a substantial number of patients die as a result of tumor progression. Overexpression of CDK6 is present in approximately one-third of medulloblastomas and is an independent poor prognostic marker for this disease. MicroRNA (miR)-124 inhibits expression of CDK6 and prevents proliferation of glioblastoma and medulloblastoma cells in vitro. We examined the effects of miR-124 overexpression on medulloblastoma cells both in vitro and in vivo and compared cell lines that have low and high CDK6 expression. MiR-124 overexpression inhibits the proliferation of medulloblastoma cells, and this effect is mediated mostly through the action of miR-124 upon CDK6. We further show that induced expression of miR-124 potently inhibits growth of medulloblastoma xenograft tumors in rodents. Further testing of miR-124 will help define the ultimate therapeutic potential of preclinical models of medulloblastoma in conjunction with various delivery strategies for treatment.",Joachim J;Rintaro R;Tristan T;Sujatmi S;Mamie M;Mitchel S MS;Jason T JT;Scott R SR;C David CD;J Graeme JG;Nalin N
23167103,[Preliminary application of absorbable fixation system on cranial bone flap reposition and fixation after craniotomy].,"To investigate the effectiveness and adverse effect of the absorbable fixation system on cranial bone flap reposition and fixation after craniotomy. Between July 2010 and December 2011, 67 cases underwent cranial bone flap reposition and fixation with absorbable fixation system after craniotomy and resection of intracranial lesions. There were 38 males and 29 females with a median age of 32 years (range, 5 months to 73 years). The disease duration ranged from 3 months to 6 years (median, 25 months). Forty-one lesions were located at supratentorial and 26 at subtentorial, including at the frontotemporal site in 13 cases, at the frontoparietal site in 12 cases, at the temporal oprietal site in 8 cases, at the temporooccipital site in 5 cases, at the occipitoparietal site in 4 cases, and at the posterior cranial fossa in 25 cases. The diagnosis results were glioma in 15 cases, cerebral vascular diseases (aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, and cavemous angioma) in 8 cases, meningioma in 7 cases, arachnoid cyst in 7 cases, acoustic neurinoma in 5 cases, cholesteatoma in 3 cases, primary trigeminal neuralgia in 5 cases, cerebral abscess in 3 cases, hypophysoma in 2 cases, craniopharyngioma in 2 cases, metastatic tumor in 2 cases, radiation encephalopathy in 2 cases, medulloblastoma in 1 case, ependymocytoma in 1 case, germinoma in 1 case, atypical teratoma/rhabdoid tumor in 1 case, facial spasm in 1 case, and subdural hematoma in 1 case. Intracranial lesion size ranged from 3 cm x 2 cm to 7 cm x 5 cm. The changes of local incision and general condition were observed. Subcutaneous effusion occurred in 2 supratentorial lesions and 3 subtentorial lesions, which was cured at 2 weeks after puncture and aspiration. All incisions healed primarily and no redness or swelling occurred. CT scans showed good reposition of the cranial bone flap and smooth inner and outer surfaces of the skull at 2 weeks after operation. All 67 patients were followed up 3-20 months (mean, 10.3 months). During follow-up, the skull had satisfactory appearance without discomfort, local depression, or effusion. Moreover, regular CT and MRI scans showed no subside, or displacement of the cranial bone flap or artifacts. Absorbable fixation system for reposition and fixation of the cranial bone flap not only is simple, safe, and reliable, but also can eliminate the postoperative CT or MRI artifact caused by metals fixation system.",Yuefei Y;Meiguang M;Jinquan J

The preoperative radiological diagnosis was vestibular schwannoma in the first case and petrosal meningioma in the second case. The patients were operated on through a retrosigmoid approach. The intraoperative findings revealed an intra-axial tumour and the histological diagnosis was classic type of MB in both cases.

23162796,MYCN: from oncoprotein to tumor-associated antigen.,"MYCN is a well-known oncogene over-expressed in different human malignancies including neuroblastoma (NB), rhabdomyosarcoma, medulloblastoma, astrocytoma, Wilms' tumor, and small cell lung cancer. In the case of NB, MYCN amplification is an established biomarker of poor-prognosis. MYCN belongs to a family of transcription factors (the most important of which is C-MYC) that show a high degree of homology. Down-regulation of MYC protein expression leads to tumor regression in animal models, indicating that MYC proteins represent interesting therapeutic targets. Pre-requisites for a candidate tumor-associated antigen (TAA) to be targeted by immunotherapeutic approaches are the following, (i) expression should be tumor-restricted, (ii) the putative TAA should be up-regulated in cancer cells, and (iii) protein should be processed into immunogenic peptides capable of associating to major histocompatibility complex molecules with high affinity. Indeed, the MYCN protein is not expressed in human adult tissues and up-regulated variably in NB cells, and MYCN peptides capable of associating to HLA-A1 or HLA-A2 molecules with high affinity have been identified. Thus the MYCN protein qualifies as putative TAA in NB. Additional issues that determine the feasibility of targeting a putative TAA with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and will be here discussed are the following, (i) the inadequacy of tumor cells per se to act as antigen-presenting cells witnessed, in the case of NB cells, by the low to absent expression of HLA class I molecules, the lack of co-stimulatory molecules and multiple defects in the HLA class I related antigen processing machinery, and (ii) the immune evasion mechanisms operated by cancer cells to fool the host immune system, such as up-regulation of soluble immunosuppressive molecules (e.g., soluble MICA and HLA-G in the case of NB) or generation of immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment. A final issue that deserves consideration is the strategy used to generate CTL.",Vito V;Fabio F;Annalisa A;Lizzia L;Ignazia I

23157748,[MicroRNA383 regulates expression of PRDX3 in human medulloblastomas].,"To investigate the effects of microRNA-383 (miR-383) on PRDX3 gene expression, cell proliferation and apoptosis of human medulloblastma. PRDX3 and miR-383 RNA expression was detected by real-time quantitative RT-PCR in human medulloblastoma tumor tissue samples, Daoy cell line and normal brain tissue samples. Western blot was used to detect protein expression of PRDX3. Synthetic miR-383 mimics were transfected into Daoy cells by lipofectamine. Using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) method, flow cytometry was used to investigate the cell proliferation and apoptosis, cells reactive oxgen species(ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential changes in each experimental groups. Of 15 cases of human medulloblastoma tumor, 13 cases had miR-383 expression levels significantly lower than that of normal brain tissue, and 14 had PRDX3 mRNA expression levels significantly higher than that of normal brain tissue. The expression levels of miR-383 and PRDX3 in Daoy cells were 0.353 and 1.315 times than those of normal brain tissue, respectively. The protein expression levels of PRDX3 were higher in human medulloblatoma tumors and Daoy cells than that of normal brain tissue. Transfected miR-383 mimics increased the expression level of miR-383 after 24 h and 48 h was significantly higher than that of the control. In contrast, PRDX3 gene mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly decreased at 48 h compared with the control group. Using CCK-8 assay, the cell proliferation rate in the experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.05). Annexin V-FITC assay demonstrated that early apoptosis rate of the experimental group (11.60 ± 0.30)% was significantly higher than those of the control group (2.3 ± 0.20)% and negative control group (10.37 ± 0.25)% (P = 0.000) after 48 h of transfection. The intracellular ROS levels after transfection at 24 and 48 h significantly increased than those of the control group. Mitochondrial membrane potential level at 24 h after transfection significantly decreased, comparing with the blank control group and the negative control group. Compared with normal brain tissue, decreased expression of miR-383 but elevated expression of PRDX3 are medulloblastoma tumour and Daoy cell lines. Up-regulation of miR-383 knockdowns the expression of PRDX3, inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis of Daoy cells, leading to increased intracellular ROS and decreased levels of mitochondrial membrane potential.",Xiao-mei XM;Shi-fen SF;Zhi-qiang ZQ;Quan-zhou QZ;Jin-tao JT;Li-kun LK;Jing J;Hong-tao HT;Han-yong HY
23157182,The inferior medullary velum: anatomical study and neurosurgical relevance.,"Although it is often visualized surgically, details regarding the inferior medullary velum are lacking in the literature. The present study is intended to better elucidate this neuroanatomical structure using microsurgical and immunohistochemical analyses. To study the inferior medullary velum, the authors performed microdissection in 15 adult cadavers. Following gross study, specimens were examined histologically. The inferior medullary velum extended from the flocculus to the middle cerebellar peduncle and stretched between the inferior cerebellar peduncle and the nodule and pyramid. The average thickness of the velum was found to be 0.5 mm (range 0.35-0.8 mm) and the average length was found to be 6 mm (range 5.5-7.2 mm). Arterial branches were identified in all specimens that arose from medullary branches of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery and supplied the inferior medullary velum. Histologically and from internal to external, a choroid plexus epithelium as a single cell layer was adjacent to a cuboidal layer of ependymal cells with no visible cilia. The next layer contained scattered glia in single cells or small clusters. The most external layer was composed of flat spindle cells resembling fibroblasts. No neurons of any type were identified. Only rare axons traversed the thin hypocellular zone that disappeared toward the midline. Based on this cadaveric study, the authors conclude that division of the inferior medullary velum should be relatively harmless as no neuronal cells were identified in this structure, which appears to be a vestigial bridge of tissue between the left and right sides of the cerebellum.",R Shane RS;Anand N AN;Marios M;Eyas M EM;Aaron A AA
23155263,Medullomyoblastoma: a case report and literature review of a rare tumor entity.,"Medullomyoblastoma (MMB) is a very rare medulloblastoma (MB) variant consisting of primitive neuroectodermal cells intermixed with cells featuring myogenic differentiation. MMBs are a subtype of primitive neuroectodermal neoplasm (PNET) predominantly occurring in children. We describe a case of a one-year-old girl who presented with headache, emesis and ataxia. The symptoms had started seven weeks before hospital admission. Magnet resonance imaging of the brain was performed, and revealed a lesion with a maximal diameter of 5 cm, located in the cerebellum close to the vermis. Histologically, the poorly-differentiated lesion was diagnosed as a type of PNET, but it was the immunohistochemical staining that assured the diagnosis of MMB. Immunohistochemistry and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. FISH did not reveal any amplification of CMYC or NMYC. No nuclear expression of β-catenin was detectable. Since MMB is a very rare tumor entity, standard treatment today is the same as that for conventional MB due to the lack of larger study series. Some authors assume that MMBs behave especially aggressive in comparison to conventional MBs. Therefore, new treatment regimes should be tested to optimize the prognosis of MMB. Further data is needed to determine the differences between MB and MMB.",Elisabeth E;Sultan S;Harald H;Christine C;Reinhold R;Johannes J
23154646,Identification of pediatric brain neoplasms using Raman spectroscopy.,"Raman spectroscopy can quickly and accurately diagnose tissue in near real-time. This study evaluated the capacity of Raman spectroscopy to diagnose pediatric brain tumors. Samples of untreated pediatric medulloblastoma (4 samples and 4 patients), glioma (i.e. astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, ependymoma, ganglioglioma and other gliomas; 27 samples and 19 patients), and normal brain samples (33 samples and 5 patients) were collected fresh from the operating room or from our frozen tumor bank. Samples were divided and tested using routine pathology and Raman spectroscopy. Twelve Raman spectra were collected per sample. Support vector machine analysis was used to classify spectra using the pathology diagnosis as the gold standard. Normal brain (321 spectra), glioma (246 spectra) and medulloblastoma (82 spectra) were identified with 96.9, 96.7 and 93.9% accuracy, respectively, when compared with each other. High-grade ependymomas (41 spectra) were differentiated from low-grade ependymomas (25 spectra) with 100% sensitivity and 96.0% specificity. Normal brain tissue was distinguished from low-grade glioma (118 spectra) with 91.5% sensitivity and 97.8% specificity. For these analyses, the tissue-level classification was determined to be 100% accurate. These results suggest Raman spectroscopy can accurately distinguish pediatric brain neoplasms from normal brain tissue, similar tumor types from each other and high-grade from low-grade tumors.",David G DG;Rachel E RE;Janet M JM;Raja R;Sandeep S;Gregory W GW;Michael D MD

Children with NBCCS also have a predisposition for secondary cancers after exposure to ionising radiation. In children undergoing imaging for posterior fossa mass and/or maxillofacial cysts, certain additional findings can raise the possibility of NBCCS.

25337109,(1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion weighted imaging findings of medulloblastoma in 3.0T MRI: A retrospective analysis of 17 cases.,"(1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion weighted imaging features of the cerebellar vermis in 17 medulloblastoma patients were retrospectively analyzed, and 17 healthy volunteers were selected as controls. (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that in all 17 medulloblastoma patients, N-acetyl aspartate and creatine peaks were significantly decreased, the choline peak was significantly increased, and there was evidence of a myo-inositol peak. Further, 11 patients showed a low taurine peak at 3.4 ppm, five patients showed a lipid peak at 0.9-1.3 ppm, and three patients showed a negative lactic acid peak at 1.33 ppm. Compared with the control group, the ratios of N-acetyl aspartate/choline and N-acetyl aspartate/creatine were significantly decreased, and the ratio of choline/creatine was increased, in medulloblastoma patients. Diffusion weighted imaging displayed hyperintensity and decreased apparent diffusion coefficient in medulloblastoma patients. These findings indicate that (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion weighted imaging are useful for qualitative diagnosis of medulloblastoma.",Guangyao G;Haopeng H;Prasanna P;Guobing G
23145127,Evaluating the effect of therapeutic stem cells on TRAIL resistant and sensitive medulloblastomas.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are emerging as novel cell-based delivery agents; however, a thorough investigation addressing their therapeutic potential in medulloblastomas (MB) has not been explored to date. In this study, we engineered human MSC to express a potent and secretable variant of a tumor specific agent, tumor necrosis factor-apoptosis-inducing ligand (S-TRAIL) and assessed the ability of MSC-S-TRAIL mediated MB killing alone or in combination with a small molecule inhibitor of histone-deacetylase, MS-275, in TRAIL-sensitive and -resistant MB in vitro and in vivo. We show that TRAIL sensitivity/resistance correlates with the expression of its cognate death receptor (DR)5 and MSC-S-TRAIL induces caspase-3 mediated apoptosis in TRAIL-sensitive MB lines. In TRAIL-resistant MB, we show upregulation of DR4/5 levels when pre-treated with MS-275 and a subsequent sensitization to MSC-S-TRAIL mediated apoptosis. Using intracranially implanted MB and MSC lines engineered with different combinations of fluorescent and bioluminescent proteins, we show that MSC-S-TRAIL has significant anti-tumor effects in mice bearing TRAIL-sensitive and MS-275 pre-treated TRAIL-resistant MBs. To our knowledge, this is the first study that explores the use of human MSC as MB-targeting therapeutic-vehicles in vivo in TRAIL-sensitive and resistant tumors, and has implications for developing effective therapies for patients with medulloblastomas.",Irina I;Simone S;Tugba T;Maarten M;Khalid K
23143003,Histone deacetylases expression in atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors.,"Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs) are rare, highly malignant central nervous system tumors that occur during infancy and early childhood. Their poor outcome and resistance to conventional chemotherapies and radiotherapy, urges the development of new therapies. Recent studies have evaluated the effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) as a new potential treatment for ATRTs. However, most HDACi act unselectively against all, or at least several, histone deacetylase (HDAC) family members. We hypothesized that specific HDAC family members are deregulated in ATRT and therefore a more selective class of HDACi would be beneficial to patients with ATRT. To test our hypothesis, we evaluated the expression level of different HDAC family members in ATRTs. Eight ATRTs were compared to six medulloblastoma samples in regards to the level of expression of the 18 HDAC family members as determined by microarray gene expression profiling. HDAC1 was the only member of the HDAC family to be significantly differentially expressed in ATRTs (FC = 4.728; p value = 0.00003). A class of HDACi specifically targeting HDAC1 may allow for the desired therapeutic benefits with fewer side effects for children with ATRT.",Simone Treiger ST;Abby L AL;Christopher A CA;Maria de Fátima Mde F;Tadanori T
23141635,[Trisomy 21 and cancers].,"Patients with trisomy 21, still called Down's syndrome (DS), present a particular tumoral profile compared to the general population with an increased incidence of leukaemia in the childhood and a low risk of solid cancer in the adulthood. DS children indeed present a 50-fold risk of developing a leukaemia compared to age-matched non-trisomic children and most of them develop a specific myelodysplasic disorder called transient myelodysplasic disorder. In spite of the low incidence of solid tumors, some are very rare as breast cancer, nephroblastoma, neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma, whereas the others remain more frequent as retinoblastoma, lymphoma and gonadal and extragonadal germ cell tumours. In this review, we present possible mechanisms which can favour, or on the contrary repress the formation and progression of tumours in DS patients, which are related to gene effect dosage of oncogenes or tumour repressors on chromosome 21, tumour angiogenesis, apoptosis and epithelial cell-stroma interactions.",W W;L L;F F;A A;A A;P P
23138228,Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 suppresses cell proliferation and enhances radiation sensitivity in medulloblastoma cells.,"Medulloblastoma accounts for 20 % of all primary pediatric intracranial tumors. Current treatment cures 50-80 % of patients but is associated with significant long-term morbidity and thus new therapeutic targets are needed. One such target is cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), a serine/threonine kinase that plays a vital role in cell cycle progression and differentiation. CDK6 is overexpressed in medulloblastoma patients and is associated with an adverse prognosis. To investigate the role of CDK6 in medulloblastoma, we assayed the effect of CDK6 inhibition on proliferation by depleting expression with RNA interference (RNAi) or by inhibiting kinase function with a small molecule inhibitor, PD0332991. Cell proliferation was assessed by colony focus assay or by the xCELLigence system. We then investigated the impact of CDK6 inhibition on differentiation of murine neural stem cells by immunofluorescence of relevant markers. Finally we evaluated the effects of PD0332991 treatment on medulloblastoma cell cycle and radiosensitivity using colony focus assays. Gene expression analysis revealed that CDK6 mRNA expression is higher than normal cerebellum in fifteen out of sixteen medulloblastoma patient samples. Inhibition of CDK6 by RNAi significantly decreased medulloblastoma cell proliferation and colony forming potential. Interestingly, CDK6 inhibition by RNAi increased differentiation in murine neural stem cells. PD0332991 treatment significantly decreased medulloblastoma cell proliferation and led to a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, PD0332991 pretreatment sensitized medulloblastoma cells to ionizing radiation. Our findings suggest that targeting CDK6 with small molecule inhibitors may prove beneficial in the treatment of medulloblastoma, especially when combined with radiation.",Susan L SL;Peter S PS;Sujatha S;Irina I;Diane K DK;Andrew M AM;Nicholas K NK;Rajeev R

23135025,Nuclear expression of β-catenin and stem cell markers as potential prognostic indicators in medulloblastoma.,"To study the prognostic role of β-catenin and stem cell markers in medulloblastoma (MB). Sixty cases of MB were retrospectively analyzed to study the expression of β-catenin, CD15, and CD133 by immunohistochemistry. Their expression was correlated with histological subtypes and event-free survival (EFS). Patients were divided into Group 1 and 2 based on non-occurrence and occurrence of events during the follow-up period. Fifty of the 60 cases were of classic type of MB while nine were of desmoplastic subtype and one case showed chondroid and rhabdomyoblastic differentiation. Immunoreactivity for β-catenin was observed as nuclear and/or cytoplasmic positivity within the tumor cells. Forty-one (68.3%) cases showed cytoplasmic positivity, while nuclear positivity was seen in 21 (35%) cases. There was a significant correlation between nuclear expression of β-catenin and different histological subtypes by Chi-square test (P value<0.05). A statistically significant positive correlation of β-catenin nuclear positivity with EFS was observed. Among 60 cases, 37 cases (67.3%) showed presence of CD15+ tumor cells with percentage of positivity varying between 0.1 to 17.1%. Overall, 42 of 60 (70%) cases showed presence of CD133+ cells. The percentage of positivity varied between 0.1 to 16.5%. A statistically significant negative correlation of CD15 and CD133 positivity with EFS was observed. Nucleopositive β-catenin cases were associated with a favorable outcome on univariate analysis. Both CD15 and CD133 positivity were associated with a worse outcome on univariate analysis.",Kiran Krishne KK;Kirti K;Rakesh R;Rakesh K RK
23134812,Treatment of medulloblastoma using an oncolytic measles virus encoding the thyroidal sodium iodide symporter shows enhanced efficacy with radioiodine.,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. Although the clinical outcome for medulloblastoma patients has improved significantly, children afflicted with the disease frequently suffer from debilitating side effects related to the aggressive nature of currently available therapy. Alternative means for treating medulloblastoma are desperately needed. We have previously shown that oncolytic measles virus (MV) can selectively target and destroy medulloblastoma tumor cells in localized and disseminated models of the disease. MV-NIS, an oncolytic measles virus that encodes the human thyroidal sodium iodide symporter (NIS), has the potential to deliver targeted radiotherapy to the tumor site and promote a localized bystander effect above and beyond that achieved by MV alone. We evaluated the efficacy of MV-NIS against medulloblastoma cells in vitro and examined their ability to incorporate radioiodine at various timepoints, finding peak uptake at 48 hours post infection. The effects of MV-NIS were also evaluated in mouse xenograft models of localized and disseminated medulloblastoma. Athymic nude mice were injected with D283med-Luc medulloblastoma cells in the caudate putamen (localized disease) or right lateral ventricle (disseminated disease) and subsequently treated with MV-NIS. Subsets of these mice were given a dose of 131I at 24, 48 or 72 hours later. MV-NIS treatment, both by itself and in combination with 131I, elicited tumor stabilization and regression in the treated mice and significantly extended their survival times. Mice given 131I were found to concentrate radioiodine at the site of their tumor implantations. In addition, mice with localized tumors that were given 131I either 24 or 48 hours after MV-NIS treatment exhibited a significant survival advantage over mice given MV-NIS alone. These data suggest MV-NIS plus radioiodine may be a potentially useful therapy for the treatment of medulloblastoma.",Brian B;Christopher R CR;Stephen J SJ;Evanthia E;Corey C;Adam W AW

The unique neuroradiographic features were confirmed by histopathology and a diagnosis of medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity was made. This case highlights the importance of recognizing this unique medulloblastoma subtype preoperatively, as the more favorable outcome may preclude less aggressive medical management.",L A LA;D M DM;D N DN;J R JR

23115191,Tis21 knock-out enhances the frequency of medulloblastoma in Patched1 heterozygous mice by inhibiting the Cxcl3-dependent migration of cerebellar neurons.,"A failure in the control of proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursor cells (GCPs), located in the external granular layer (EGL) of the cerebellum, gives rise to medulloblastoma. To investigate the process of neoplastic transformation of GCPs, we generated a new medulloblastoma model by crossing Patched1 heterozygous mice, which develop medulloblastomas with low frequency, with mice lacking the Tis21 gene. Overexpression of Tis21 is known to inhibit proliferation and trigger differentiation of GCPs; its expression decreases in human medulloblastomas. Double-knock-out mice show a striking increase in the frequency of medulloblastomas and hyperplastic EGL lesions, formed by preneoplastic GCPs. Tis21 deletion does not affect the proliferation of GCPs but inhibits their differentiation and, chiefly, their intrinsic ability to migrate outside the EGL. This defect of migration may represent an important step in medulloblastoma formation, as GCPs, remaining longer in the EGL proliferative niche, may become more prone to transformation. By genome-wide analysis, we identified the chemokine Cxcl3 as a target of Tis21. Cxcl3 is downregulated in Tis21-null GCPs of EGL and lesions; addition of Cxcl3 to cerebellar slices rescues the defective migration of Tis21-null GCPs and, remarkably, reduces the area of hyperplastic lesions. As Tis21 activates Cxcl3 transcription, our results suggest that Tis21 induces migration of GCPs through Cxcl3, which may represent a novel target for medulloblastoma therapy.",Stefano S;Irene I;Manuela M;Laura L;Luca L;Maria Teresa MT;Marco M;Concezio C;Roberto R;Sebastiano S;Felice F
23115013,Recombinant anti-podoplanin (NZ-1) immunotoxin for the treatment of malignant brain tumors.,"Our study demonstrates the glioma tumor antigen podoplanin to be present at very high levels (>90%) in both glioblastoma (D2159MG, D08-0308MG and D08-0493MG) and medulloblastoma (D283MED, D425MED and DAOY) xenografts and cell line. We constructed a novel recombinant single-chain antibody variable region fragment (scFv), NZ-1, specific for podoplanin from the NZ-1 hybridoma. NZ-1-scFv was then fused to Pseudomonas exotoxin A, carrying a C-terminal KDEL peptide (NZ-1-PE38KDEL). The immunotoxin (IT) was further stabilized by a disulfide (ds) bond between the heavy-chain and light-chain variable regions as the construct NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL. NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL exhibited significant reactivity to glioblastoma and medulloblastoma cells. The affinity of NZ-1-(scdsFv), NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL and NZ-1 antibody for podoplanin peptide was 2.1 × 10(-8) M, 8.0 × 10(-8) M and 3.9 × 10(-10) M, respectively. In a protein stability assay, NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL retained 33-98% of its activity, whereas that of NZ-1-PE38KDEL declined to 13% of its initial levels after incubation at 37°C for 3 days. In vitro cytotoxicity of the NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL was measured in cells isolated from glioblastoma xenografts, D2159MG, D08-0308MG and D08-0493MG, and in the medulloblastoma D283MED, D425MED and DOAY xenografts and cell line. The NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL IT was highly cytotoxic, with an 50% inhibitory concentration in the range of 1.6-29 ng/ml. Significantly, NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL demonstrated tumor growth delay, averaging 24 days (p < 0.001) and 21 days (p < 0.001) in D2159MG and D283MED in vivo tumor models, respectively. Crucially, in the D425MED intracranial tumor model, NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL caused a 41% increase in survival (p ≤ 0.001). In preclinical studies, NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL exhibited significant potential as a targeting agent for malignant brain tumors.",Vidyalakshmi V;Xuhui X;Mika M;Yukinari Y;Stephen T ST;Scott E SE;Chien-Tsun CT;Ira H IH;Darell D DD
23095836,Molecular markers in pediatric neuro-oncology.,"Pediatric molecular neuro-oncology is a fast developing field. A multitude of molecular profiling studies in recent years has unveiled a number of genetic abnormalities unique to pediatric brain tumors. It has now become clear that brain tumors that arise in children have distinct pathogenesis and biology, compared with their adult counterparts, even for those with indistinguishable histopathology. Some of the molecular features are so specific to a particular type of tumors, such as the presence of the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion gene for pilocytic astrocytomas or SMARCB1 mutations for atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, that they could practically serve as a diagnostic marker on their own. Expression profiling has resolved the existence of 4 molecular subgroups in medulloblastomas, which positively translated into improved prognostication for the patients. The currently available molecular markers, however, do not cover all tumors even within a single tumor entity. The molecular pathogenesis of a large number of pediatric brain tumors is still unaccounted for, and the hierarchy of tumors is likely to be more complex and intricate than currently acknowledged. One of the main tasks of future molecular analyses in pediatric neuro-oncology, including the ongoing genome sequencing efforts, is to elucidate the biological basis of those orphan tumors. The ultimate goal of molecular diagnostics is to accurately predict the clinical and biological behavior of any tumor by means of their molecular characteristics, which is hoped to eventually pave the way for individualized treatment.",Koichi K;Ryo R;Masao M
23095827,Cerebral white matter integrity and executive function in adult survivors of childhood medulloblastoma.,"Survivors of pediatric medulloblastoma are at risk for neurocognitive dysfunction. Reduced white matter integrity has been correlated with lower intelligence in child survivors, yet associations between specific cognitive processes and white matter have not been examined in long-term adult survivors. Twenty adult survivors of medulloblastoma were randomly recruited from a larger institutional cohort of adult survivors of childhood cancer. Survivors underwent comprehensive neurocognitive evaluations and MRI. Data on brain volume and cortical thickness and diffusion tensor imaging were acquired, including measures of fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient, and axial and radial diffusivity. Observed neurocognitive scores were compared with population norms and correlated to MRI indices. Survivors were, on average, 29 years of age and 18 years postdiagnosis. Mean full-scale intelligence quotient was nearly 1 SD below the normative mean (86.3 vs 100, P = .004). Seventy-five percent of survivors were impaired on at least one measure of executive function. Radial diffusivity in the frontal lobe of both hemispheres was correlated with shifting attention (left: r(s) = -0.67, P = .001; right: r(s) = -0.64, P = .002) and cognitive flexibility (left: r(s) = -0.56, P = .01; right: r(s) = -0.54, P = .01). Volume and cortical thickness were not correlated with neurocognitive function. Neurocognitive impairment was common and involved many domains. Reduced white matter integrity in multiple brain regions correlated with poorer performance on tasks of executive function. Future research integrating diffusion tensor imaging should be a priority to more rigorously evaluate long-term consequences of cancer treatment and to inform cognitive intervention trials in this high-risk population.",Tara M TM;Wilburn E WE;Joshua J;John O JO;Noah D ND;Deo Kumar DK;Leslie L LL;Melissa M MM;Kevin R KR
23109381,A dual neural network ensemble approach for multiclass brain tumor classification.,"The present study is conducted to develop an interactive computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for assisting radiologists in multiclass classification of brain tumors. In this paper, primary brain tumors such as astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme, childhood tumor-medulloblastoma, meningioma and secondary tumor-metastases along with normal regions are classified by a dual level neural network ensemble. Two hundred eighteen texture and intensity features are extracted from 856 segmented regions of interest (SROIs) and are taken as input. PCA is used for reduction of dimensionality of the feature space. The study is performed on a diversified dataset of 428 post contrast T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of 55 patients. Two sets of experiments are performed. In the first experiment, random selection is used which may allow SROIs from the same patient having similar characteristics to appear in both training and testing simultaneously. In the second experiment, not even a single SROI from the same patient is common during training and testing. In the first experiment, it is observed that the dual level neural network ensemble has enhanced the overall accuracy to 95.85% compared with 91.97% of single level artificial neural network. The proposed method delivers high accuracy for each class. The accuracy obtained for each class is: astrocytoma 96.29%, glioblastoma multiforme 96.15%, childhood tumor-medulloblastoma 90%, meningioma 93.00%, secondary tumor-metastases 96.67% and normal regions 97.41%. This study reveals that dual level neural network ensemble provides better results than the single level artificial neural network. In the second experiment, overall classification accuracy of 90.4% was achieved. The generalization ability of this approach can be tested by analyzing larger datasets. The extensive training will also further improve the performance of the proposed dual network ensemble. Quantitative results obtained from the proposed method will assist the radiologist in forming a better decision for classifying brain tumors.",Jainy J;Vinod V;Indra I;Niranjan N;Chirag Kamal CK
23099653,Survival and secondary tumors in children with medulloblastoma receiving radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy: results of Children's Oncology Group trial A9961.,"The purpose of the trial was to determine the survival and incidence of secondary tumors in children with medulloblastoma receiving radiotherapy plus chemotherapy. Three hundred seventy-nine eligible patients with nondisseminated medulloblastoma between the ages of 3 and 21 years were treated with 2340 cGy of craniospinal and 5580 cGy of posterior fossa irradiation. Patients were randomized between postradiation cisplatin and vincristine plus either CCNU or cyclophosphamide. Survival, pattern of relapse, and occurrence of secondary tumors were assessed. Five- and 10-year event-free survivals were 81 ± 2% and 75.8 ± 2.3%; overall survivals were 87 ± 1.8% and 81.3 ± 2.1%. Event-free survival was not impacted by chemotherapeutic regimen, sex, race, age at diagnosis, or gender. Seven patients had disease relapse beyond 5 years after diagnosis; relapse was local in 4 patients, local plus supratentorial in 2, and supratentorial alone in 1. Fifteen patients experienced secondary tumors as a first event at a median time of 5.8 years after diagnosis (11 >5 y postdiagnosis). All non-CNS solid secondary tumors (4) occurred in regions that had received radiation. Of the 6 high-grade gliomas, 5 occurred >5 years postdiagnosis. The estimated cumulative 10-year incidence rate of secondary malignancies was 4.2% (1.9%-6.5%). Few patients with medulloblastoma will relapse ≥ 5 years postdiagnosis; relapse will occur predominantly at the primary tumor site. Patients are at risk for development of secondary tumors, many of which are malignant gliomas. This may become an increasing issue as more children survive.",Roger J RJ;Tianni T;Emi E;Gilbert G;Amar A

In search for common tumorigenic denominators, we analyzed 113 central and peripheral nervous system tumors, including glial tumors (grades I-IV gliomas), medulloblastomas, and neuroblastomas. NAV3 copy number changes were studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization and correlated to survival analyses. To identify target genes of NAV3 deletion, NAV3 was silenced by siRNA in glioblastoma cell lines and gene expression profiles were analyzed by Agilent 4×44k dual-color microarrays. Selected upregulations were confirmed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We found NAV3 amplifications to dominate in neuronally differentiated tumors, whereas glial tumors showed almost equal proportions of NAV3 deletion and amplification. However, Grade IV gliomas had more frequent NAV3 deletions than grades I-III gliomas. Silencing of NAV3 in glioma cell lines led to the upregulation of receptor genes associated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone and Jak-Stat signaling pathways. Kaplan-Meier analysis of the entire clinical tumor material showed association between NAV3 amplifications and favorable prognosis, as well as NAV3 deletions and unfavorable prognosis. With Cox regression model, a hazard ratio of 0.51 was observed for NAV3 amplifications and 1.36 for NAV3 deletions. We conclude that NAV3 may be a potential new prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target.",Emilia E;Kai K;Kristian K;Pia P;Valtteri V;Pilvi P;Anu A;Miikka M;Riku R;Samer S;Seppo S;Kirsi K;Sampsa S;Hannu H;Annamari A
23094051,Characterization of ectonucleotidases in human medulloblastoma cell lines: ecto-5'NT/CD73 in metastasis as potential prognostic factor.,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children and occurs mainly in the cerebellum. Important intracellular signaling molecules, such those present in the Sonic Hedgehog and Wnt pathways, are involved in its development and can also be employed to determine tumor grade and prognosis. Ectonucleotidases, particularly ecto-5'NT/CD73, are important enzymes in the malignant process of different tumor types regulating extracellular ATP and adenosine levels. Here, we investigated the activity of ectonucleotidases in three malignant human cell lines: Daoy and ONS76, being representative of primary MB, and the D283 cell line, derived from a metastatic MB. All cell lines secreted ATP into the extracellular medium while hydrolyze poorly this nucleotide, which is in agreement with the low expression and activity of pyrophosphate/phosphodiesterase, NTPDases and alkaline phosphatase. The analysis of AMP hydrolysis showed that Daoy and ONS76 completely hydrolyzed AMP, with parallel adenosine production (Daoy) and inosine accumulation (ONS76). On the other hand, D283 cell line did not hydrolyze AMP. Moreover, primary MB tumor cells, Daoy and ONS76 express the ecto-5'NT/CD73 while D283 representative of a metastatic tumor, revealed poor expression of this enzyme, while the ecto-adenosine deaminase showed higher expression in D283 compared to Daoy and ONS76 cells. Nuclear beta-catenin has been suggested as a marker for MB prognosis. Further it can promotes expression of ecto-5'NT/CD73 and suppression of adenosine deaminase. It was observed that Daoy and ONS76 showed greater nuclear beta-catenin immunoreactivity than D283, which presented mainly cytoplasmic immunoreactivity. In summary, the absence of ecto-5'NT/CD73 in the D283 cell line, a metastatic MB phenotype, suggests that high expression levels of this ectonucleotidase could be correlated with a poor prognosis in patients with MB.",Angélica Regina AR;Liliana L;Fabrícia F;Vanessa V;Talita T;Elizandra E;Ana Lúcia AL;Rafael R;Henning H;Ana Maria Oliveira AM
23082872,The effect of alpha-v integrin inhibition on the malignant characteristics of medulloblastoma.,"Hypoxia induces an aggressive phenotype in some brain tumors in part due to hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and integrin expression. The importance of hypoxia in medulloblastoma is unclear and the interaction of HIF-1α and c-Myc in medulloblastoma has not been explored. The objective of this study was to determine if hypoxia induces an aggressive phenotype in human medulloblastoma cells that constitutively express high (D283 Med) or low (DAOY) levels of c-Myc and to determine if blocking α(v) integrins with the monoclonal antibody intetumumab inhibits hypoxia-induced cellular stress responses. Cells were grown at 21% and 1% O(2) and in the presence or absence of intetumumab. Measures of malignancy evaluated included cell proliferation, cell migration, and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), α(v) integrins, HIF-1α, and c-Myc. Both cell lines robustly expressed α(v) integrins. Hypoxic DAOY cells showed significantly increased proliferation compared with normoxic controls (p < 0.05), whereas D283 Med cells did not. Both cell lines exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in proliferation when treated with intetumumab (p < 0.05). Hypoxia did not increase DAOY migration, but intetumumab significantly inhibited migration at both oxygen conditions (p < 0.05). Intetumumab significantly decreased VEGF levels in DAOY cells at both oxygen conditions (p < 0.05) and in normoxic D283 cells (p < 0.01). Neither cell line demonstrated increased HIF-1α expression in response to hypoxia. However, hypoxic D283 Med cells grown in the presence of intetumumab demonstrated significantly decreased c-Myc expression (p < 0.05). Hypoxia did not clearly induce a more aggressive phenotype in medulloblastoma cells. Despite this result, intetumumab decreased medulloblastoma cell proliferation and migration and variably decreased VEGF and c-Myc expression in hypoxic conditions. Targeting α(v) integrins represents a promising potential adjuvant modality in the treatment of medulloblastoma, particularly subtypes that metastasize and overexpress VEGF and c-Myc.",Eric M EM;Nathaniel L NL;Y Jeffrey YJ;Edward A EA
23076602,Cytogenetic findings in pediatric radiation-induced atypical meningioma after treatment of medulloblastoma: case report and review of the literature.,"Ionizing radiation is the most recognized risk factor for meningioma in pediatric long-term cancer survivors. Information in this rare setting is exceptional. We report the clinical and cytogenetic findings in a radiation-induced atypical meningioma following treatment for desmoplastic medulloblastoma in a child. This is the second study to describe the cytogenetic aspects on radiation-induced meningiomas in children. Chromosome banding analysis revealed a 46, XX, t(1;3)(p22;q12), del(1)(p?)[8]/46, XX[12]. Loss of chromosome 1p as a consequence of irradiation has been proposed to be more important in the development of secondary meningiomas in adults.

23065688,Glutathione S-transferase P1 single nucleotide polymorphism predicts permanent ototoxicity in children with medulloblastoma.,"Glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes are involved in detoxifying chemotherapy and clearing reactive oxygen species formed by radiation. We explored the relationship between the host GSTP1 105 A > G polymorphism (rs1695), tumor GSTpi protein expression, and clinical outcomes in pediatric medulloblastoma. We hypothesized that the GSTP1 105 G-allele and increased tumor GSTpi expression would be associated with lower progression-free survival and fewer adverse events. The study included 106 medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) patients seen at Texas Children's Cancer Center. Genotyping was performed using an Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip and GSTpi expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry. We used the Kaplan-Meier method for survival analyses and logistic regression for toxicity comparisons. Patients with a GSTP1 105 AG/GG genotype (vs. AA) or who had received high dose craniospinal radiation (≥34 Gy vs. <26 Gy) had a greater risk of requiring hearing aids than their counterparts (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.2-13.6, and OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.1-8.8, respectively, n = 69). Additionally, there was a statistically significant interaction between these variables. Compared with the lowest risk group (GSTP1 105 AA-low dose radiation), patients with a GSTP1 105 AG/GG genotype who received high dose radiation were 8.4 times more likely to require hearing aids (95% CI 1.4-49.9, p-trend = 0.005, n = 69). When adjusted for age, cumulative cisplatin dose, and amifostine use, the association remained. The GSTP1 105 G-allele is associated with permanent ototoxicity in pediatric medulloblastoma/PNET and strongly interacts with radiation dose. Patients with this allele should be considered for clinical trials employing radiation dose modifications and cytoprotectant strategies.",Surya S;Michael E ME;Adekunle A;Ching C CC;Mehmet Fatih MF
23065639,Bmi1 overexpression in the cerebellar granule cell lineage of mice affects cell proliferation and survival without initiating medulloblastoma formation.,"BMI1 is a potent inducer of neural stem cell self-renewal and neural progenitor cell proliferation during development and in adult tissue homeostasis. It is overexpressed in numerous human cancers - including medulloblastomas, in which its functional role is unclear. We generated transgenic mouse lines with targeted overexpression of Bmi1 in the cerebellar granule cell lineage, a cell type that has been shown to act as a cell of origin for medulloblastomas. Overexpression of Bmi1 in granule cell progenitors (GCPs) led to a decrease in cerebellar size due to decreased GCP proliferation and repression of the expression of cyclin genes, whereas Bmi1 overexpression in postmitotic granule cells improved cell survival in response to stress by altering the expression of genes in the mitochondrial cell death pathway and of Myc and Lef-1. Although no medulloblastomas developed in ageing cohorts of transgenic mice, crosses with Trp53(-/-) mice resulted in a low incidence of medulloblastoma formation. Furthermore, analysis of a large collection of primary human medulloblastomas revealed that tumours with a BMI1(high) TP53(low) molecular profile are significantly enriched in Group 4 human medulloblastomas. Our data suggest that different levels and timing of Bmi1 overexpression yield distinct cellular outcomes within the same cellular lineage. Importantly, Bmi1 overexpression at the GCP stage does not induce tumour formation, suggesting that BMI1 overexpression in GCP-derived human medulloblastomas probably occurs during later stages of oncogenesis and might serve to enhance tumour cell survival.",Hourinaz H;Heeta H;Adrian M AM;Michael D MD;Silvia S
23063729,Time perception in children treated for a cerebellar medulloblastoma.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate temporal abilities in children treated by surgery for a malignant tumor in the cerebellum. Children with a diagnosed medulloblastoma and age-paired control children were given a temporal discrimination task (bisection task) and a temporal reproduction task with two duration ranges, one shorter than 1s and the other longer than 4s. The motor and cognitive capacities of these children were also assessed by a battery of age-adapted neuropsychological tests. The results did not show any significant difference in performance between the children with or without cerebellar lesions in the temporal discrimination task. It was only in the temporal reproduction task that the children with cerebellar lesions reproduced longer and more variable durations than the other children, but only for the short stimulus durations (≤ 1 s). In addition, a hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the best predictor of variance in temporal performance was a significantly lower processing speed in children with cerebellar lesions in comparison to their controls. These results indicated that the major cause of deficits in temporal judgments in children with cerebellar lesions was due to their inability to reproduce accurately short temporal intervals in association with low processing speed, rather than to a specific deficit in the perception of time.",Sylvie S;Pierre S PS;Georges G;Virginie V;Nicole N;Bruce L BL;Valérie V;Joëlle J;Jacques J
23063522,Identification of a novel Smoothened antagonist that potently suppresses Hedgehog signaling.,"The Hedgehog signaling pathway plays an essential role in embryo development and adult tissue homeostasis, in regulating stem cells and is abnormally activated in many cancers. Given the importance of this signaling pathway, we developed a novel and versatile high-throughput, cell-based screening platform using confocal imaging, based on the role of β-arrestin in Hedgehog signal transduction, that can identify agonists or antagonist of the pathway by a simple change to the screening protocol. Here we report the use of this assay in the antagonist mode to identify novel antagonists of Smoothened, including a compound (A8) with low nanomolar activity against wild-type Smo also capable of binding the Smo point mutant D473H associated with clinical resistance in medulloblastoma. Our data validate this novel screening approach in the further development of A8 and related congeners to treat Hedgehog related diseases, including the treatment of basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma.",Jiangbo J;Robert A RA;Jiuyi J;David M DM;Anthony A;Anchen A;Larry S LS;H Kim HK;Wei W

23056595,Novel agents targeting the IGF-1R/PI3K pathway impair cell proliferation and survival in subsets of medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma.,"The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is fundamental for cancer cell proliferation and is known to be frequently altered and activated in neoplasia, including embryonal tumors. Based on the high frequency of alterations, targeting components of the PI3K signaling pathway is considered to be a promising therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. Here, we have investigated the potential of targeting the axis of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and PI3K signaling in two common cancers of childhood: neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial tumor in children and medulloblastoma, the most frequent malignant childhood brain tumor. By treating neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma cells with R1507, a specific humanized monoclonal antibody against the IGF-1R, we could observe cell line-specific responses and in some cases a strong decrease in cell proliferation. In contrast, targeting the PI3K p110α with the specific inhibitor PIK75 resulted in broad anti-proliferative effects in a panel of neuro- and medulloblastoma cell lines. Additionally, sensitization to commonly used chemotherapeutic agents occurred in neuroblastoma cells upon treatment with R1507 or PIK75. Furthermore, by studying the expression and phosphorylation state of IGF-1R/PI3K downstream signaling targets we found down-regulated signaling pathway activation. In addition, apoptosis occurred in embryonal tumor cells after treatment with PIK75 or R1507. Together, our studies demonstrate the potential of targeting the IGF-1R/PI3K signaling axis in embryonal tumors. Hopefully, this knowledge will contribute to the development of urgently required new targeted therapies for embryonal tumors.",Anna A;Fabiana F;Ditte G DG;Tiziana T;Paulina P;Tarek T;Nicole N;Michael A MA;Alexandre A
23054560,HD-MB03 is a novel Group 3 medulloblastoma model demonstrating sensitivity to histone deacetylase inhibitor treatment.,"Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in childhood. Emerging evidence suggests that medulloblastoma comprises at least four distinct diseases (WNT, SHH, Group 3 and 4) with different biology, clinical presentation, and outcome, with especially poor prognosis in Group 3. The tight connection of biology and clinical behavior in patients emphasizes the need for subgroup-specific preclinical models in order to develop treatments tailored to each subgroup. Herein we report on the novel cell line HD-MB03, isolated from tumor material of a patient with metastasized Group 3 medulloblastoma, and preclinical testing of different histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) in this model. HD-MB03 cells grow long term in vitro and form metastatic tumors in vivo upon orthotopic transplantation. HD-MB03 cells reflect the original Group 3 medulloblastoma at the histological and molecular level, showing large cell morphology, similar expression patterns for markers Ki67, p53, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a gene expression profile most closely matching Group 3 medulloblastomas, and persistence of typical molecular alterations, i.e., isochromosome 17q [i(17q)] and MYC amplification. Protein expression analysis of HDACs 2, 5, 8, and 9 as well as the predictive marker HR23B showed intermediate to strong expression, suggesting sensitivity to HDACis. Indeed, treatment with HDACis Helminthosporium carbonum (HC)-toxin, vorinostat, and panobinostat revealed high sensitivity to this novel drug class, as well as a radiation-sensitizing effect with significantly increased cell death upon concomitant treatment. In summary, our data indicate that HD-MB03 is a suitable preclinical model for Group 3 medulloblastoma, and HDACis could represent a therapeutic option for this subgroup.",Till T;Marco M;Larissa L;Andrey A;Marcel M;Lena M LM;André S L M AS;Ina I;Arnulf A;Stefan M SM;Andreas E AE;Olaf O;Hedwig E HE
23045271,Distinct roles for fibroblast growth factor signaling in cerebellar development and medulloblastoma.,"Cerebellar granule neurons are the most abundant neurons in the brain, and a critical element of the circuitry that controls motor coordination and learning. In addition, granule neuron precursors (GNPs) are thought to represent cells of origin for medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Thus, understanding the signals that control the growth and differentiation of these cells has important implications for neurobiology and neurooncology. Our previous studies have shown that proliferation of GNPs is regulated by Sonic hedgehog (Shh), and that aberrant activation of the Shh pathway can lead to medulloblastoma. Moreover, we have demonstrated that Shh-dependent proliferation of GNPs and medulloblastoma cells can be blocked by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). But while the mitogenic effects of Shh signaling have been confirmed in vivo, the inhibitory effects of bFGF have primarily been studied in culture. Here, we demonstrate that mice lacking FGF signaling in GNPs exhibit no discernable changes in GNP proliferation or differentiation. In contrast, activation of FGF signaling has a potent effect on tumor growth: treatment of medulloblastoma cells with bFGF prevents them from forming tumors following transplantation, and inoculation of tumor-bearing mice with bFGF markedly inhibits tumor growth in vivo. These results suggest that activators of FGF signaling may be useful for targeting medulloblastoma and other Shh-dependent tumors.",B A BA;E I EI;C C;S L SL;S N SN;J W JW;T-A TA;M P MP;A R AR;D L DL;C C;W L WL;R J RJ
23043706,Advances in molecular targets for the treatment of medulloblastomas.,"To present an assortment of molecular targets evident from a variety of signal transduction pathways and downstream effectors, which may have clinical relevance for the treatment of medulloblastomas. Data were archived from MEDLINE, using Boolean-formatted queries on the keywords including: medulloblastoma, pathology, prognosis, classification, tumor regression, inhibition, therapy, clinical trial, therapeutic agent, drug, molecular inhibitor, and signalling pathway. Only the most reputable articles were selected for critical analyses based on the qualitative assessment of the citation index, novelty of the findings and relevance to prospective novel ways of targeted therapies for medulloblastomas. Medulloblastomas are highly aggressive embryonal tumors of the cerebellum, akin to primitive neuroectodermal tumors elsewhere in the brain. Current treatments for medulloblastomas which include a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, remain challenging especially, for younger patients; however, advances in understanding regulatory pathways in medulloblastomas are crucial to develop more effective therapeutic targets. Evidence showing several molecular and pharmacological targets within key signalling pathways, such as HEDGEHOG, WNT, NOTCH, Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (ERB, IGF-IR, c-MET, PDGF, Estrogen, p75NTR) , their downstream effectors like PI3K/AKT, c-MYC and STAT3, and as well as other targets such as telomerase and cytoskeletal elements, is summarized. All molecular and pharmacological targets have pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of medulloblastomas. Most importantly, these pathways can be effectively pharmacologically targeted to regress the growth of medulloblastomas. Pre-clinical studies were routinely undertaken with a variety of human and murine cell lines and as well as murine models of medulloblastomas. Thus far, two drugs which target the NOTCH and HEDGEHOG signalling have completed Phase I clinical trials, but with evidence of low efficacies; hence, reinforcing the importance of continuing investigations in search of new therapeutic agents and targets. Novel therapies, based on better understanding key biological pathways in medulloblastomas, hold promise for improved treatments in due course among patients with medulloblastomas.",Norbert F NF;Hao Y HY;Peter P;Deepak D
23038047,Factors predicting the need for cerebrospinal fluid diversion following posterior fossa tumor surgery in children.,"No consensus exists regarding the management of hydrocephalus in children with posterior fossa tumors before, during or after surgery. In the present study we analyze the factors that predispose to persistent hydrocephalus and the need for a postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion procedure. Pediatric patients who underwent surgery for posterior fossa tumors with hydrocephalus at our hospital were reviewed to evaluate the need for a postoperative CSF diversion procedure. Patients having undergone CSF diversion preoperatively were excluded from the study group. The case records of 84 patients were reviewed. The factors evaluated included age at diagnosis, duration of symptoms, severity of preoperative hydrocephalus, tumor size, tumor location, tumor histology, extent of tumor resection and postoperative complications that could be related to CSF circulation disorders. At the time of presentation, 80/84 (95.2%) patients had symptomatic hydrocephalus; 25/84 (29.8%) patients required a CSF diversion procedure in the postoperative period. Children presenting with symptom duration of less than 3 months had a significantly higher requirement for postoperative CSF diversion in comparison to those with longer symptomatology (p = 0.016). Evan's index and frontal and occipital horn ratio on preoperative imaging were found to correlate closely with the need for postoperative shunt (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). The requirement for shunt was statistically higher in patients with midline tumors in comparison to laterally placed lesions (p = 0.04) and in children with medulloblastoma (p < 0.001) and ependymoma (p = 0.016) as the tumor subtypes. Children who underwent intraoperative external ventricular drainage (EVD) had a shunt insertion rate of 39.6% compared with 16.7% of those who did not have an EVD (p < 0.001). Patients with meningitis and pseudomeningocele in the postoperative period had a statistically significant higher risk of shunt requirement (p = 0.008 and p = 0.016, respectively). The mean age at diagnosis and the extent of tumor resection did not correlate with the need for CSF diversion. The fact that less than one-third of patients require a CSF diversion after posterior fossa tumor resection refutes the role of prophylactic endoscopic third ventriculostomy. Awareness regarding the factors that can predict persistent postoperative hydrocephalus is essential for the surgeon during patient counseling and surgical planning, and also in deciding the intensity of postoperative clinical and radiological monitoring.",C V CV;Amit A;Girish G;Suresh S
23036849,Accurate classification of childhood brain tumours by in vivo ¹H MRS - a multi-centre study.,"To evaluate the accuracy of single-voxel Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) as a non-invasive diagnostic aid for paediatric brain tumours in a multi-national study. Our hypotheses are (1) that automated classification based on (1)H MRS provides an accurate non-invasive diagnosis in multi-centre datasets and (2) using a protocol which increases the metabolite information improves the diagnostic accuracy. Seventy-eight patients under 16 years old with histologically proven brain tumours from 10 international centres were investigated. Discrimination of 29 medulloblastomas, 11 ependymomas and 38 pilocytic astrocytomas (PILOAs) was evaluated. Single-voxel MRS was undertaken prior to diagnosis (1.5 T Point-Resolved Spectroscopy (PRESS), Proton Brain Exam (PROBE) or Stimulated Echo Acquisition Mode (STEAM), echo time (TE) 20-32 ms and 135-136 ms). MRS data were processed using two strategies, determination of metabolite concentrations using TARQUIN software and automatic feature extraction with Peak Integration (PI). Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was applied to this data to produce diagnostic classifiers. An evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy was performed based on resampling to measure the Balanced Accuracy Rate (BAR). The accuracy of the diagnostic classifiers for discriminating the three tumour types was found to be high (BAR 0.98) when a combination of TE was used. The combination of both TEs significantly improved the classification performance (p<0.01, Tukey's test) compared with the use of one TE alone. Other tumour types were classified accurately as glial or primitive neuroectodermal (BAR 1.00). (1)H MRS has excellent accuracy for the non-invasive diagnosis of common childhood brain tumours particularly if the metabolite information is maximised and should become part of routine clinical assessment for these children.",Javier J;Elies E;Salvador S;Juan M JM;Nigel N;Kal K;Martin M;Richard G RG;Pieter P;Daniel D;Bernardo B;Montserrat M;Andrew C AC
23036338,Vismodegib and the hedgehog pathway: a new treatment for basal cell carcinoma.,"Vismodegib is an oral inhibitor of the Hedgehog pathway approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. It is the first systemic treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma that is not amenable to surgery and radiation. This is the first drug to use the Hedgehog pathway to inhibit the proliferation of tumors and is also implicated in the development of other cancers such as medulloblastoma. The goal of this review was to summarize the development, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of vismodegib. Relevant English-language literature was identified and then evaluated based on results from database searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1975 to June 19, 2012. The terms searched included, but were not limited to, vismodegib, Erivedge, GDC-0449, basal cell carcinoma, and 2-chloro-N-[4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl]-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzamide. Additional literature was identified by assessing the reference lists of previously identified articles and through abstracts presented by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. A total of 70 full text citations were identified although two national conference proceedings were then excluded. An additional 10 published abstracts were also identified. A Phase II, nonrandomized, multicenter, international study demonstrated a 30.3% objective response rate in metastatic basal cell carcinoma and a 42.9% objective response rate in locally advanced basal cell carcinoma. The adverse effect profile for vismodegib is similar to other identified Hedgehog pathway inhibitors; muscle cramps (71.7%), alopecia (63.8%), and dysgeusia (55.1%) were the most common adverse effects seen in trials. A Phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Gorlin syndrome patients with basal cell carcinoma concluded that vismodegib was significantly better than placebo at reducing new basal cell carcinoma lesions (P < 0.001) and at decreasing the sum of the longest diameter of existing lesions (P = 0.003). For patients with unresectable basal cell carcinoma or where resection would be cosmetically disadvantageous, vismodegib is an effective therapy with good response rates. At this time, the data are too limited to determine overall survival. The Hedgehog pathway is a newly identified area in which mutations or dysregulation can occur, leading to the development and progression of tumors. Studies continue to look at other cancers with involvement of the Hedgehog pathway.",Frank F;Christy S CS
23032746,"A phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled study of vismodegib as maintenance therapy in patients with ovarian cancer in second or third complete remission.","Hedgehog pathway inhibition has been suggested as a potential maintenance treatment approach in ovarian cancer through disruption of tumor-stromal interactions. Vismodegib is an orally available Hedgehog pathway inhibitor with clinical activity in advanced basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma. This phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed to provide a preliminary estimate of efficacy in patients with ovarian cancer in second or third complete remission (CR). Patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer in second or third CR were randomized 1:1 to vismodegib (GDC-0449; 150 mg daily) or placebo three to 14 weeks after completing chemotherapy. Treatment continued until radiographic progression or toxicity. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). One hundred four patients were randomized to vismodegib (n = 52) or placebo (n = 52); median PFS was 7.5 months and 5.8 months, respectively [HR 0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.46-1.35]. The HR was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.36-1.20) for second CR patients (n = 84) and 1.79 (95% CI, 0.50-6.48) for third CR patients (n = 20). The most common adverse events in the vismodegib arm were dysgeusia/ageusia, muscle spasms, and alopecia. Grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 12 patients (23.1%) with vismodegib and six (11.5%) with placebo. Hedgehog expression was detected in 13.5% of archival tissues. In this study, the sought magnitude of increase in PFS was not achieved for vismodegib maintenance versus placebo in patients with ovarian cancer in second or third CR. The frequency of Hedgehog ligand expression was lower than expected.",Stanley B SB;Louis L;Robert R;Amnon A;Beth B;Brian B;Paul P;Ling L;Robert L RL;Ilsung I;Josina C JC
23018623,Neural stem cell-based dual suicide gene delivery for metastatic brain tumors.,"In our previous works, we demonstrated that human neural stem cells (NSCs) transduced with the cytosine deaminase (CD) gene showed remarkable 'bystander killer effect' on glioma and medulloblastoma cells after administration of the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC). In addition, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) is a widely studied enzyme used for suicide gene strategies, for which the prodrug is ganciclovir (GCV). To apply this strategy to brain metastasis treatment, we established here a human NSC line (F3.CD-TK) expressing the dual suicide genes CD and TK. We examined whether F3.CD-TK cells intensified the antitumor effect on lung cancer brain metastases. In vitro studies showed that F3.CD-TK cells exerted a marked bystander effect on human lung cancer cells after treatment with 5-FC and GCV. In a novel experimental brain metastases model, intravenously administered F3 cells migrated near lung cancer metastatic lesions, which were induced by the injection of lung cancer cells via the intracarotid artery. More importantly, F3.CD-TK cells in the presence of prodrugs 5-FC and GCV decreased tumor size and considerably prolonged animal survival. The results of the present study indicate that the dual suicide gene-engineered, NSC-based treatment strategy might offer a new promising therapeutic modality for brain metastases.",C C;A A;H J HJ;K K;Y Y;M M;M M;S S;H H;K K;F F;T T;S U SU
23018595,Non-cell autonomous control of apoptosis by ligand-independent Hedgehog signaling in Drosophila.,"Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is important for development and homeostasis in vertebrates and invertebrates. Ligand-independent, deregulated Hh signaling caused by loss of negative regulators such as Patched causes excessive cell proliferation, leading to overgrowth in Drosophila and tumors in humans, including basal-cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma. We show that in Drosophila deregulated Hh signaling also promotes cell survival by increasing the resistance to apoptosis. Surprisingly, cells with deregulated Hh activity do not protect themselves from apoptosis; instead, they promote cell survival of neighboring wild-type cells. This non-cell autonomous effect is mediated by Hh-induced Notch signaling, which elevates the protein levels of Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (Diap-1), conferring resistance to apoptosis. In summary, we demonstrate that deregulated Hh signaling not only promotes proliferation but also cell survival of neighboring cells. This non-cell autonomous control of apoptosis highlights an underappreciated function of deregulated Hh signaling, which may help to generate a supportive micro-environment for tumor development.",A E AE;T T;Y Y;H K HK;H-M HM;J L JL;A A

23012247,Targeting the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins as a novel therapeutic strategy in medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. Novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to overcome cytotoxic resistance. We hypothesized that antiapoptotic signals contribute to resistance and that treatment with proapoptotic agents could increase the efficacy of conventional therapies. A PCR array was used to assess the status of the apoptotic signaling pathway in medulloblastoma cells after treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Treatment with cisplatin led to the upregulation of antiapoptotic signals, including inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP), in medulloblastoma cells. We subsequently investigated the synergistic effect of a small-molecule IAP inhibitor, LBW242, in combination with cisplatin and/or radiotherapy in three human medulloblastoma cell lines and 5 short term primary patient medulloblastoma cultures. The addition of LBW242 to chemotherapy resulted in significantly increased antitumor activity with a similar effect observed in combination with radiotherapy. Measurement of caspase-8 and -9 activity indicated that the synergy resulted from induction of both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Apoptosis was confirmed by Annexin V staining and activation of caspases 3/7. Xenograft models were used to evaluate the mechanism of action and efficacy in vivo. The combination therapy significantly reduced the tumor burden in a medulloblastoma xenograft model and TUNEL analysis in a medulloblastoma orthograft confirmed in vivo induction of apoptosis. These findings support the strategy of targeting IAPs in combination with cytotoxic therapy as a novel treatment strategy for patients with medulloblastoma.",Joanna J;Maria M;Andrew R AR;Wendy J WJ;Michelle M;David S DS
23007316,Preclinical evaluation of the novel 7-substituted camptothecin Namitecan (ST1968) in paediatric tumour models.,"The present study aimed to evaluate the new water soluble camptothecin analogue Namitecan (ST1968) in preclinical paediatric tumour models of the nervous system comprehensive of neuroblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumours/PNET and medulloblastoma where the drug was compared to Irinotecan. Cellular sensitivity to the drug was assessed by MTT and clonogenic assays. Propidium iodide staining was used for cell cycle perturbation studies. The genotoxic effects were quantified by Comet assay, whereas apoptosis was assessed by PARP cleavage and sub-G1 accumulation. Tumour response was investigated in xenograft models in nude mice. The cellular response to Namitecan was heterogeneous with IC(50) (2 h) ranging between 0.14 and 13.26 μM, whereas SN38 (the active metabolite of Irinotecan) appeared more effective (IC(50): 0.03-11.7 μM). Interestingly, prolonged drug incubation times up to 72 h enhanced Namitecan cytotoxicity, with similar colony inhibition curves between the two analogues (IC(50), nM-SN38: 0.9 ± 0.2; Namitecan: 0.7 ± 0.4). DNA damage, accumulation in late-S/G2 phases and induction of apoptosis appeared important players of Namitecan cytotoxicity in our models. In vivo, Namitecan was superior to Irinotecan in three out of five xenograft models, with reversible weight loss (10 %). In the sensitive SK-N-AS xenograft, Namitecan showed a high retention in tumours consistently with: high antitumour response, rapid drug-mediated DNA damage (60 % mean TailDNA after 1 h from drug inoculation), persistent cell cycle perturbation (60-40 % G2 accumulation after 48-72 h, respectively) and apoptosis. Studies with Namitecan and platinum agents in this model showed a significant enhancement of antitumour activity of the drugs combination versus single agents. Our preclinical data strongly support the interest of further investigations on the well-tolerated Namitecan either as a single agent or in combination in paediatric oncology.",Daniela D;Angela Maria AM;Gabriella G;Federica F;Filomena F;Valentina V;Anna Rita AR;Claudio C;Riccardo R
23002030,Early cisplatin induced ototoxicity profile may predict the need for hearing support in children with medulloblastoma.,"Cisplatin (CDDP) ototoxicity is a significant side effect of the current treatment of medulloblastoma (MB). Cumulative dose of CDDP and age are recognized risk factors for hearing loss, but inter-individual susceptibility limits our ability to identify patients at risk for hearing loss. We describe the kinetics of early audiometric changes during therapy and identify profiles associated with a higher risk of needing hearing aids. Serial audiometric evaluations were performed during and after completion of therapy in children with average risk (AR) and high-risk (HR) MB. Each audiogram was scored according to five grading systems. Variations of pure tone thresholds were analyzed at each frequency for each consecutive audiogram. CDDP dose modifications and hearing outcome were recorded. A total of 258 audiograms from 35 patients (22 AR, 13 HR) were analyzed. Eighteen AR patients (81.3%) required dose reduction and the median cumulative dose of CDDP administered was 412.5 mg/m(2) (150-600), corresponding to 68% of the intended dose. Three HR patients (23.0%) required dose reduction. At a median follow-up of 67 months (11-117), nine patients (25.7%) required hearing support: After two cycles of CDDP (150 mg/m(2) ), the average hearing loss at 8,000 Hz was twice higher in the group that eventually required hearing support. Early alteration of high-frequency thresholds may help identify individuals who will require hearing support. In the MB population, alternative strategies should be developed to limit the cumulative dose of CDDP to prevent significant ototoxicity.",Lucie L;Eve E;Annie A;Sharon L SL;Vicky V;Alberto A;Eric E

The case-parent triad design overcomes these limitations. Therefore, we conducted an exploratory study among 27 childhood medulloblastoma case-parent triads recruited from the Childhood Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Center at Texas Children's Hospital (Houston, USA) between 2003 and 2010. We assessed 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nine xenobiotic detoxification genes, as deficiencies in this pathway may induce brain tumorigenesis. Log-linear modeling was used to assess the association between medulloblastoma and both the offspring (i.e., case) and maternal genotypes of each SNP. In our population, there were no offspring genotypes that were significantly associated with disease risk. However, the maternal EPHX1 rs1051740 genotype (RR = 3.26, P = .01) was associated with medulloblastoma risk. This exploratory study highlights the utility of the case-parent triad design, but these results should be interpreted cautiously due to the limited sample size.",Philip J PJ;Darryl D;M Fatih MF;Murali M;Michael E ME
22993678,Destructive radiologic development of intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia on skull bone.,"Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia (IPEH) is a rare vascular benign lesion that rarely involves the central nervous system with or without skull invasion. We report a rare case of IPEH on the skull bone, which displayed destructive radiologic development associated with hemorrhage. A 14-year-old male presented with an incidentally detected a small enhancing, left frontal osteolytic lesion. Previously, he underwent operation and received adjuvant chemoradiation therapy for cerebellar medulloblastoma. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left frontal bone lesion, which expanded to an approximately 2 cm-sized well-circumscribed osteolytic lesion associated with hemorrhage for 20 months. Frontal craniectomy and cranioplasty were performed. Destructive change was detected on the inner table and diploic space of the skull. The mass had a cystic feature with hemorrhagic content without dural attachment. Pathologic examination showed the capsule consisted of parallel collagen lamellae representing a vascular wall, vascular lumen, which was pathognomonic for IPEH. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the capsule was positive for CD34 and factor VIII, which favor the final diagnosis of IPEH. This was the first case of intracalvarial IPEH.",Seul-Kee SK;Tae-Young TY;Hee-Jo HJ;Seul-Kee SK
22993333,Chemotherapy dose-intensity and survival for childhood medulloblastoma.,"To determine the relationship between prescribed dose-intensity of chemotherapy and survival in childhood medulloblastoma. A total of 55 trials from 1970-2009 were identified, 30 were eligible for analysis, with individual treatment regimes with 5-year (or more) outcome figures. Relationships of outcome to dose-intensity were analysed using weighted regression. Overall, 2,434 patients were identified, 1,010 were classified as 'standard'- and 671 as 'high'-risk patients, with 5-year overall survivals (OS) of 67.2% (95% Confidence Interval=60.5%-73.6%) and 47.6% (95% Confidence Interval=39.5%-55.7%), respectively. A protective effect for chemotherapy versus craniospinal radiotherapy alone (5-year OS of 58.2% versus 51.6%) was found. Individually, vincristine, cisplatin, lomustine (CCNU) and cyclophosphamide appear to confer the most beneficial effect, particularly for high-risk patients. Positive relationships between OS and dose-intensity were found, except for lomustine, with cyclophosphamide offering the greatest protection. Consideration of chemotherapy dose-intensity may further optimise treatment, particularly in the context of risk stratification.",R L RL;X X;E J EJ
22992748,A role for transcription factor STAT3 signaling in oncogene smoothened-driven carcinogenesis.,"Activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is known to drive development of basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastomas and to associate with many other types of cancer, but the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the carcinogenesis process remain elusive. We discovered that skin tumors derived from epidermal expression of oncogenic Smo, SmoM2, have elevated levels of IL-11, IL-11Rα, and STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr(705). The relevance of our data to human conditions was reflected by the fact that all human basal cell carcinomas examined have detectable STAT3 phosphorylation, mostly in keratinocytes. The functional relevance of STAT3 in Smo-mediated carcinogenesis was revealed by epidermal specific knockout of STAT3. We showed that removal of STAT3 from mouse epidermis dramatically reduced SmoM2-mediated cell proliferation, leading to a significant decrease in epidermal thickness and tumor development. We also observed a significant reduction of epidermal stem/progenitor cell population and cyclin D1 expression in mice with epidermis-specific knockout of STAT3. Our evidence indicates that STAT3 signaling activation may be mediated by the IL-11/IL-11Rα signaling axis. We showed that tumor development was reduced after induced expression of SmoM2 in IL-11Rα null mice. Similarly, neutralizing antibodies for IL-11 reduced the tumor size. In two Hh-responsive cell lines, ES14 and C3H10T1/2, we found that addition of Smo agonist purmorphamine is sufficient to induce STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr(705), but this effect was abolished after IL-11Rα down-regulation by shRNAs. Taken together, our results support an important role of the IL-11Rα/STAT3 signaling axis for Hh signaling-mediated signaling and carcinogenesis.",Dongsheng D;Qipeng Q;Xiaoli X;Jingwu J
22986744,OTX2 represses myogenic and neuronal differentiation in medulloblastoma cells.,"The brain development transcription factor OTX2 is overexpressed and/or genomically amplified in most medulloblastomas, but the mechanistic basis for its contributions in this setting are not understood. In this study, we identified OTX2 as a transcriptional repressor and a gatekeeper of myogenic and neuronal differentiation in medulloblastoma cells. OTX2 binds to the MyoD1 core enhancer through its homeobox domain, and the remarkable repressor activity exhibited by the homeobox domain renders OTX2 transcriptionally repressive. RNA interference-mediated attenuation of OTX2 expression triggered myogenic and neuronal differentiation in vitro and prolonged the survival in an orthotopic medulloblastoma mouse model. Conversely, inducing myogenic conversion of medulloblastoma cells led to the loss of OTX2 expression. In medullomyoblastoma, a medulloblastoma subtype containing muscle elements, myogenic cells share cytogenetic signatures with the primitive tumor cells and OTX2 expression was lost in the differentiated myogenic cells. Thus, OTX2 functions via its homeobox domain as a suppressor of differentiation, and the loss of OTX2 expression is linked to the myogenesis in medullomyoblastoma. Together, our findings illustrate the origin of muscle cells in medullomyoblastomas and the oncogenic mechanism of OTX2 as a repressor of diverse differentiating potential.",Ren-Yuan RY;Verena V;Hart G HG;Charles G CG;Gregory J GJ

22985791,The RNA-binding protein Musashi1 affects medulloblastoma growth via a network of cancer-related genes and is an indicator of poor prognosis.,"Musashi1 (Msi1) is a highly conserved RNA-binding protein that is required during the development of the nervous system. Msi1 has been characterized as a stem cell marker, controlling the balance between self-renewal and differentiation, and has also been implicated in tumorigenesis, being highly expressed in multiple tumor types. We analyzed Msi1 expression in a large cohort of medulloblastoma samples and found that Msi1 is highly expressed in tumor tissue compared with normal cerebellum. Notably, high Msi1 expression levels proved to be a sign of poor prognosis. Msi1 expression was determined to be particularly high in molecular subgroups 3 and 4 of medulloblastoma. We determined that Msi1 is required for tumorigenesis because inhibition of Msi1 expression by small-interfering RNAs reduced the growth of Daoy medulloblastoma cells in xenografts. To characterize the participation of Msi1 in medulloblastoma, we conducted different high-throughput analyses. Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis (RIP-chip) was used to identify mRNA species preferentially associated with Msi1 protein in Daoy cells. We also used cluster analysis to identify genes with similar or opposite expression patterns to Msi1 in our medulloblastoma cohort. A network study identified RAC1, CTGF, SDCBP, SRC, PRL, and SHC1 as major nodes of an Msi1-associated network. Our results suggest that Msi1 functions as a regulator of multiple processes in medulloblastoma formation and could become an important therapeutic target.",Dat T DT;Dharmalingam D;Marc M;Tarea L TL;Philip J PJ;Jonathan A JA;Raquel R;Suzanne C SC;Mei M;Uthra U;Andrey A;Adrian M AM;Paul A PA;Andrew D AD;Stefan M SM;Michael D MD;Sarath C SC;Shrikant S;Christine C;Luiz O F LO
22984599,"Bag3-induced autophagy is associated with degradation of JCV oncoprotein, T-Ag.","JC virus, JCV, is a human neurotropic polyomavirus whose replication in glial cells causes the fatal demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). In addition, JCV possesses oncogenic activity and expression of its transforming protein, large T-antigen (T-Ag), in several experimental animals induces tumors of neural origin. Further, the presence of JCV DNA and T-Ag have been repeatedly observed in several human malignant tissues including primitive neuroectodermal tumors and glioblastomas. Earlier studies have demonstrated that Bag3, a member of the Bcl-2-associated athanogene (Bag) family of proteins, which is implicated in autophagy and apoptosis, is downregulated upon JCV infection of glial cells and that JCV T-Ag is responsible for suppressing the activity of the BAG3 promoter. Here, we investigated the possible impact of Bag3 on T-Ag expression in JCV-infected human primary glial cells as well as in cells derived from T-Ag-induced medulloblastoma in transgenic animals. Results from these studies revealed that overexpression of Bag3 drastically decreases the level of T-Ag expression by inducing the autophagic degradation of the viral protein. Interestingly, this event leads to the inhibition of JCV infection of glial cells, suggesting that the reduced levels of T-antigen seen upon the overexpression of Bag3 has a biological impact on the viral lytic cycle. Results from protein-protein interaction studies showed that T-Ag and Bag3 physically interact with each other through the zinc-finger of T-Ag and the proline rich domains of Bag3, and this interaction is important for the autophagic degradation of T-Ag. Our observations open a new avenue of research for better understanding of virus-host interaction by investigating the interplay between T-Ag and Bag3, and their impact on the development of JCV-associated diseases.",Ilker Kudret IK;Nana N;Prem Kumer PK;Tijana T;Alessandra A;Maria C MC;Kamel K
22984561,Apoptosis induced by knockdown of uPAR and MMP-9 is mediated by inactivation of EGFR/STAT3 signaling in medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma is a highly invasive cancer of central nervous system diagnosed mainly in children. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) are over expressed in several cancers and well established for their roles in tumor progression. The present study is aimed to determine the consequences of targeting these molecules on medulloblastoma progression. Radiation is one of the foremost methods applied for treating cancer and considerable evidence showed that radiation elevated uPAR and MMP-9 expression in medulloblastoma cell. Therefore efforts are made to target these molecules in non-irradiated and irradiated medulloblastoma cells. Our results showed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of uPAR and MMP-9, either alone or in combination with radiation modulated a series of events leading to apoptosis. Down regulation of uPAR and MMP-9 inhibited the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules like Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin, XIAP and cIAPI; activated BID cleavage, enhanced the expression of Bak and translocated cyctochrome C to cytosol. Capsase-3 and -9 activities were also increased in uPAR- and MMP-9-downregulated cells. The apoptosis induced by targeting MMP-9 and uPAR was initiated by inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mediated activation of STAT3 and NF-κB related signaling molecules. Silencing uPAR and MMP-9 inhibited DNA binding activity of STAT3 and also reduced the recruitment of STAT3 protein at the promoter region of Bcl-2 and survivin genes. Our results suggest that inhibiting uPAR and MMP-9 reduced the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules by inactivating the transcriptional activity of STAT3. In addition, treating pre-established medulloblastoma with siRNAs against uPAR and MMP-9 both alone or in combination with radiation suppressed uPAR, MMP-9, EGFR, STAT3 expression and induced Bak activation leading to apoptosis. Taken together, our results illustrated that RNAi mediated targeting of uPAR and MMP-9 might have therapeutic potential against medulloblastoma.",Ramaprasada Rao RR;Arun Kumar AK;Swapna S;Christopher S CS;Dzung H DH;Jasti S JS

Rapidly measuring these endpoints is often hampered by the lack of efficient assay platforms with high sensitivity and specificity. Using an in vivo model system, we report a simple and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay to quantify the bioavailability of a recently developed novel cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor VMY-1-103, a purvalanol B-based analog whose biological activity is enhanced via dansylation. We developed a rapid organic phase extraction technique and validated wide and functional VMY-1-103 distribution in various mouse tissues, consistent with its enhanced potency previously observed in a variety of human cancer cell lines.

22982441,Oncostatin M is a growth factor for Ewing sarcoma.,"Primary bone tumors, osteosarcomas and chondrosarcomas, derive from mesenchymal stem cells committed into osteoblasts and chondrocytes; in Ewing sarcomas (ESs), the oncogenic fusion protein EWS-FLI1 prevents mesenchymal differentiation and induces neuroectodermic features. Oncostatin M (OSM) is a cytokine from the IL-6 family that modulates proliferation and differentiation in numerous cells. The basis for inhibition versus induction of proliferation by this cytokine is obscure, although MYC was described as a potent molecular switch in OSM signaling. We show herein that, in contrast to osteosarcomas and chondrosarcomas, for which OSM was cytostatic, OSM induced proliferation of ES cell lines. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that growth induction by OSM depends on both types I [leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR)] and II [OSM receptor (OSMR)] receptors, high STAT3 activation, and induction of MYC to a high expression level. Indeed, ES cell lines, mice xenografts, and patient biopsy specimens poorly expressed LIF, precluding LIFR lysosomal degradation and OSMR transcriptional induction, thus leading to a high LIFR/OSMR ratio. Because other neuroectodermic tumors (ie, glioma, medulloblastoma, and neuroblastoma) had a similar expression profile, the main role of EWS-FLI1 could be through maintenance of stemness and neuroectodermic features, characterized by a low LIF, a high LIFR/OSMR ratio, and high MYC expression. Thus, this study on rare bone malignancies gives valuable insights on more common cancer regulatory mechanisms and could provide new therapeutic opportunities.",Emmanuelle E;Franck F;Marc M;Pierre P;Karine K;Olivier O;Marie F MF;Dominique D;Françoise F;Frédéric F
22981874,The incidence of medulloblastomas and primitive neurectodermal tumours in adults and children.,"Medulloblastomas (MB) and primitive neurectodermal tumours (PNET) are known to affect children more than adults. To estimate the magnitude of the differences between the incidence of adults and children, the incidence rates, ratios and time trends of MB and PNET in children and adults are measured using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Results (SEER) database. Between 1973 and 2007 in the SEER 9 registries, 1372 people were diagnosed with a MB and 530 with a PNET. The overall incidence rate of MB and PNET is approximately 1.5 and 0.62 per million population in the USA. Children (1-9 years of age) with MB had an incidence rate of 6.0, compared to 0.6 in adults, and therefore children are 10 times more likely to be affected by an MB than adults. Children are 4.6 times as likely to be afflicted by a PNET than adults. The difference in incidence rates based on sex existed only in children. Our study confirmed that the incidence rates of MB has not changed over time.",Nicolas R NR;Katharine J KJ
22980291,Identification of suitable endogenous control genes for microRNA expression profiling of childhood medulloblastoma and human neural stem cells.,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common type of malignant childhood brain tumour. Although deregulated microRNA (miRNA) expression has been linked to MB pathogenesis, the selection of appropriate candidate endogenous control (EC) reference genes for MB miRNA expression profiling studies has not been systematically addressed. In this study we utilised reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to identify the most appropriate EC reference genes for the accurate normalisation of miRNA expression data in primary human MB specimens and neural stem cells. Expression profiling of 662 miRNAs and six small nuclear/ nucleolar RNAs in primary human MB specimens, two CD133+ neural stem cell (NSC) populations and two CD133- neural progenitor cell (NPC) populations was performed using TaqMan low-density array (TLDA) cards. Minimal intra-card variability for candidate EC reference gene replicates was observed, however significant inter-card variability was identified between replicates present on both TLDA cards A and B. A panel of 18 potentially suitable EC reference genes was identified for the normalisation of miRNA expression on TLDA cards. These candidates were not significantly differentially expressed between CD133+ NSCs/ CD133- NPCs and primary MB specimens. Of the six sn/snoRNA EC reference genes recommended by the manufacturer, only RNU44 was uniformly expressed between primary MB specimens and CD133+ NSC/CD133- NPC populations (P = 0.709; FC = 1.02). The suitability of candidate EC reference genes was assessed using geNorm and NormFinder software, with hsa-miR-301a and hsa-miR-339-5p found to be the most uniformly expressed EC reference genes on TLDA card A and hsa-miR-425* and RNU24 for TLDA card B. A panel of 18 potential EC reference genes that were not significantly differentially expressed between CD133+ NSCs/ CD133- NPCs and primary human MB specimens was identified. The top ranked EC reference genes described here should be validated in a larger cohort of specimens to verify their utility as controls for the normalisation of RT-qPCR data generated in MB miRNA expression studies. Importantly, inter-card variability observed between replicates of certain candidate EC reference genes has major implications for the accurate normalisation of miRNA expression data obtained using the miRNA TLDA platform.",Laura A LA;Denise D;Kim W KW;Keith M KM;Peter B PB

Early diagnosis is often challenging due to initial non-specific clinical symptoms, especially in very young children. The typical MR features of tumours in this region including medulloblastoma, ependymoma, juvenile pilocytic subtype of cerebellar astrocytoma, brain stem glioma and atypical teratoid-rhabdoid tumour are illustrated. Diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient values combined with signal characteristics on conventional MR sequences can usually differentiate low-grade from high-grade tumours.

22976800,Mismatch repair deficiency: a temozolomide resistance factor in medulloblastoma cell lines that is uncommon in primary medulloblastoma tumours.,"Tumours are responsive to temozolomide (TMZ) if they are deficient in O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), and mismatch repair (MMR) proficient. The effect of TMZ on medulloblastoma (MB) cell killing was analysed with clonogenic survival assays. Expression of DNA repair genes and enzymes was investigated using microarrays, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. DNA sequencing and promoter methylation analysis were employed to investigate the cause of loss of the expression of MMR gene MLH1. Temozolomide exhibited potent cytotoxic activity in D425Med (MGMT deficient, MLH1 proficient; IC(50)=1.7 μM), moderate activity against D341Med (MGMT proficient, MLH1 deficient), and DAOY MB cells (MGMT proficient, MLH1 proficient). MGMT inhibitor O(6)-benzylguanine sensitised DAOY, but not D341Med cells to TMZ. Of 12 MB cell lines, D341Med, D283Med, and 1580WÜ cells exhibited MMR deficiency due to MLH1 promoter hypermethylation. DNA sequencing of these cells provided no evidence for somatic genetic alterations in MLH1. Expression analyses of MMR and MGMT in MB revealed that all patient specimens (n=74; expression array, n=61; immunostaining, n=13) are most likely MMR proficient, whereas some tumours had low MGMT expression levels (according to expression array) or were totally MGMT deficient (3 out of 13 according to immunohistochemistry). A subset of MB may respond to TMZ as some patient specimens are MGMT deficient, and tumours appear to be MMR proficient.",A O AO;M D MD;C C;K K;A A;U U;T T;J J;M A MA;H S HS;G G;M M;S S
22970210,Genomic DNA copy-number alterations of the let-7 family in human cancers.,"In human cancer, expression of the let-7 family is significantly reduced, and this is associated with shorter survival times in patients. However, the mechanisms leading to let-7 downregulation in cancer are still largely unclear. Since an alteration in copy-number is one of the causes of gene deregulation in cancer, we examined copy number alterations of the let-7 family in 2,969 cancer specimens from a high-resolution SNP array dataset. We found that there was a reduction in the copy number of let-7 genes in a cancer-type specific manner. Importantly, focal deletion of four let-7 family members was found in three cancer types: medulloblastoma (let-7a-2 and let-7e), breast cancer (let-7a-2), and ovarian cancer (let-7a-3/let-7b). For example, the genomic locus harboring let-7a-3/let-7b was deleted in 44% of the specimens from ovarian cancer patients. We also found a positive correlation between the copy number of let-7b and mature let-7b expression in ovarian cancer. Finally, we showed that restoration of let-7b expression dramatically reduced ovarian tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that copy number deletion is an important mechanism leading to the downregulation of expression of specific let-7 family members in medulloblastoma, breast, and ovarian cancers. Restoration of let-7 expression in tumor cells could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer.",Yanling Y;Xiaowen X;Joel J;Liang L;Xiaojun X;Zhongjun Z;Shun S;Janos L JL;Anil K AK;Lin L
22966790,Canonical TGF-β pathway activity is a predictor of SHH-driven medulloblastoma survival and delineates putative precursors in cerebellar development.,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. Very little is known about aggressive forms of this disease, such as metastatic or recurrent MBs. In order to identify pathways involved in aggressive MB pathophysiology, we performed unbiased, whole genome microarrays on MB tumors at both the human and murine levels. Primary human MBs were compared, transcriptomically, to their patient-matched recurrent or metastatic tumors. Expression profiling was also performed on murine tumors from two spontaneously developing MB mouse models (Ptch+/- and Smo/Smo) that present with differing clinical severities. At both the human and murine levels we identified transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) as a potential contributor to MB progression/metastasis. Smad3, a major downstream component of the TGF-β pathway, was also evaluated using immunohistochemistry in malignant human tissues and was shown to correlate with MB metastasis and survival. Similarly, Smad3 expression during development identified a subset of cerebellar neuronal precursors as putative cells of origin for the Smad3-positive MBs. To our knowledge, this is the first study that links TGF-β to MB pathogenesis. Our research suggests that canonical activation of this pathway leads to better prognosis for patients.",Donya D;Connor J CJ;Sameer S;Vijay V;Adrian M AM;Paul A PA;Michael D MD;Arie A;James M JM;Charles G CG;Sidney E SE
22963240,De novo engineering of a human cystathionine-γ-lyase for systemic (L)-Methionine depletion cancer therapy.,"It has been known for nearly a half century that human tumors, including those derived from the nervous system such as glioblastomas, medulloblastoma, and neuroblastomas are much more sensitive than normal tissues to l-methionine (l-Met) starvation. More recently, systemic l-Met depletion by administration of Pseudomonas putida methionine-γ-lyase (MGL) could effectively inhibit human tumors xenografted in mice. However, bacterial-derived MGLs are unstable in serum (t(1/2) = 1.9 ± 0.2 h) and highly immunogenic in primates. Since the human genome does not encode a human MGL enzyme, we created de novo a methionine degrading enzyme by reengineering the structurally homologous pyridoxal phosphate-dependent human enzyme cystathionine-γ-lyase (hCGL). hCGL degrades l-cystathionine but displays no promiscuous activity toward l-Met. Rational design and scanning saturation mutagenesis led to the generation of a variant containing three amino acid substitutions (hCGL-NLV) that degraded l-Met with a k(cat)/K(M) of 5.6 × 10(2) M(-1) s(-1) and displayed a serum deactivation t(1/2) = 78 ± 5 h (non-PEGylated). In vitro, the cytotoxicity of hCGL-NLV toward 14 neuroblastoma cell lines was essentially indistinguishable from that of the P. putida MGL. Intravenous administration of PEGylated hCGL-NLV in mice reduced serum l-Met from 123 μM to <5 μM for over 30 h. Importantly, treatment of neuroblastoma mouse xenografts with PEGylated hCGL-NLV resulted in near complete cessation of tumor growth. Since the mode of action of hCGL-NLV does not require breaching the blood-brain barrier, this enzyme may have potential application for sensitive tumors that arise from or metastasize to the central nervous system.",Everett E;Olga O;Jian J;Barbara B;Nai-Kong NK;George G
22959284,Prognostic and clinical implication of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 8 expression in pediatric medulloblastoma.,"To investigate the expression patterns and clinical value of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 8 (ADAM8) in pediatric medulloblastoma. We evaluated the expression of ADAM8 mRNA and protein in pediatric medulloblastoma tissues by Quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot analysis and Immunohistochemical staining, respectively. The correlation of ADAM8 immunostaining with clinical-pathological features of medulloblastoma patients and its prognostic relevance were further determined. ADAM8 mRNA and protein were both most highly expressed in medulloblastoma tissues when compared with normal cerebellum tissues (both P<0.001). According to the immunohistochemisty analysis, we found statistically significant correlations of high ADAM8 protein expression with advanced metastatic stage (P=0.01), aggressive histopathological type (P=0.006), as well as with undifferentiated tumor (P=0.02). We further determined a statistically significant association between ADAM8 protein expression and clinical outcome of medulloblastoma patients, with higher expression levels of ADAM8 associating with a worse overall survival (P=0.02). Our results provide the first evidence that the up-regulation of ADAM8 in medulloblastoma tissues might be correlated with the advanced tumor progression and poor prognosis of patients with this disease. Detection of ADAM8 expression might facilitate the prognostic assessment and improve the therapeutic strategy for medulloblastoma patients.",Rongrong R;Yufang Y;Jiandong J;Wenguang W
22958902,Loss of SUFU function in familial multiple meningioma.,"Meningiomas are the most common primary tumors of the CNS and account for up to 30% of all CNS tumors. An increased risk of meningiomas has been associated with certain tumor-susceptibility syndromes, especially neurofibromatosis type II, but no gene defects predisposing to isolated familial meningiomas have thus far been identified. Here, we report on a family of five meningioma-affected siblings, four of whom have multiple tumors. No NF2 mutations were identified in the germline or tumors. We combined genome-wide linkage analysis and exome sequencing, and we identified in suppressor of fused homolog (Drosophila), SUFU, a c.367C>T (p.Arg123Cys) mutation segregating with the meningiomas in the family. The variation was not present in healthy controls, and all seven meningiomas analyzed displayed loss of the wild-type allele according to the classic two-hit model for tumor-suppressor genes. In silico modeling predicted the variant to affect the tertiary structure of the protein, and functional analyses showed that the activity of the altered SUFU was significantly reduced and therefore led to dysregulated hedgehog (Hh) signaling. SUFU is a known tumor-suppressor gene previously associated with childhood medulloblastoma predisposition. Our genetic and functional analyses indicate that germline mutations in SUFU also predispose to meningiomas, particularly to multiple meningiomas. It is possible that other genic mutations resulting in aberrant activation of the Hh pathway might underlie meningioma predisposition in families with an unknown etiology.",Mervi M;Song-Ping SP;Silva S;Pia P;Eevi E;Ekaterina E;Yilong Y;Kari K;Miriam J MJ;D Gareth R DG;Minna M;Anne A;Anssi A;Lauri A LA;Jussi J;Pia P
22952198,Clinical and neuroanatomical predictors of cerebellar mutism syndrome.,"Cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) is an important medical challenge in the management of pediatric posterior fossa brain tumors, because it occurs in a subset of children following tumor resection. A definitive clinical profile and neuroanatomical substrate associated with CMS remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between presurgical and clinical variables and the incidence of CMS, along with diffusion tensor imaging, to characterize the integrity of cerebello-thalamo-cerebral white matter pathways. Seventeen children with posterior fossa tumors and CMS, 34 children with posterior fossa tumors without CMS, and 28 healthy children were enrolled in this study. Bilateral cerebello-thalamo-cerebral pathways were delineated and segmented into anatomical regions. Mean integrity measures for each region were compared among children with CMS, children without CMS, and healthy children. Left-handedness, medulloblastoma histology, and larger tumor size distinguished between patients with CMS and patients without CMS (P < .04). Right cerebellar white matter within the cerebello-thalamo-cerebral pathway was compromised in children with CMS relative to children without CMS and healthy children (P < .02). We provide a potential schema for CMS risk among children treated for posterior fossa tumors. Left-handed children treated for medulloblastoma may be the most at risk for CMS, and unilateral, localized damage within the cerebello-thalamo-cerebral pathway at the level of the right cerebellum is implicated in the presentation of CMS. This disruption in communication between the right cerebellum and left frontal cortex may contribute to speech-language problems observed in children with CMS. Our findings may be relevant for surgical planning and speech-language therapy to mitigate symptoms of CMS.",Nicole N;Mark M;Eric E;Michael D MD;Suzanne S;Douglas D;Christopher C;Dina D;Juliette J;Caelyn C;Frank F;Donald J DJ
22951319,In vitro stemness characterization of radio-resistant clones isolated from a medulloblastoma cell line ONS-76.,"One-third of patients with medulloblastoma die due to recurrence after various treatments including radiotherapy. Although it has been postulated that cancer stem-like cells are radio-resistant and play an important role in tumor recurrence, the ""stemness"" of medulloblastoma cells surviving irradiation has not yet been elucidated. Using a medulloblastoma cell line ONS-76, cells that survived gamma irradiation were investigated on their ""stemness"" in vitro. From 10 500 cells, 20 radio-resistant clones were selected after gamma ray irradiation (5 Gy × two fractions) using the replica micro-well technique. These 20 resistant clones were screened for CD133 positivity by flow cytometry followed by side population assay, tumor sphere formation assay and clonogenic survival assay. Results revealed CD133 fractions were significantly elevated in three clones, which also exhibited significantly increased levels of tumor sphere formation ability and side population fraction. Clonogenic survival assay demonstrated that their radio-resistance was significantly higher than the parental ONS-76. This may support the hypothesis that a small number of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are the main culprits in local recurrence after radiotherapy, and disruption of the resistance mechanism of these CSCs is a critical future issue in improving the outcome of patients with medulloblastoma.",Lue L;Takashi T;Yun-Wen YW;Kenshi K;Ariungerel A;Zhengshan Z;Junko J;Hideki H;Koji K
22944718,Potentiation of etoposide and temozolomide cytotoxicity by curcumin and turmeric force™ in brain tumor cell lines.,"We have investigated on the potentiation of etoposide (ETP) and temozolomide (TMZ) cytotoxicity in U-87MG glioblastoma and D283 medulloblastoma cell lines by curcumin (CUR) and turmeric force (TF), a nutraceutical formulation of turmeric, with the objective of assessing the potential for their adjuvant use in brain tumor chemotherapy. While U-87MG cell line was generally resistant to TMZ, IC50 values for CUR and TF were 37.33 and 30.75 µg/ml, respectively. TF is the only agent that demonstrated efficacy at the IC90 level. When CUR or TF was combined with ETP and TMZ, increased chemotherapeutic efficiency in the U-87MG cells was observed. TF is highly cytotoxic to D283 Med cell line compared to curcumin with an IC50 value of 1.55 ug/ml. Although both CUR and TF potentiated ETP and TMZ cytotoxicity, TF is more efficient than CUR in both U-87MG and D283 Med cell lines. Treatment of U-87MG cells with the triple combination of TMZ+ETP+TF induced a high percentage of apoptotic cells. Potential mechanisms that may explain evidence of synergy include down regulation of p10 and p53 mRNAs and increase in BAX/Bcl-2 mRNA ratio. These pre-clinical results suggest that TF may be useful as an adjuvant with ETP and TMZ for brain tumor chemotherapy.",Cheppail C;Smitha M SM;Enrique E;Steven J SJ
22941475,Small molecule inhibitors of the hedgehog signaling pathway for the treatment of cancer.,"Over the past decade, the Hedgehog signaling pathway has attracted considerable interest because the pathway plays important roles in the tumorigenesis of several types of cancer as well as developmental processes. It has also been observed that Hedgehog signaling regulates the proliferation and self-renewal of cancer stem cells. A great number of Hedgehog pathway inhibitors have been discovered through small molecule screens and subsequent medicinal chemistry efforts. Among the inhibitors, several Smo antagonists have reached the clinical trial phase. It has been proved that the inhibition of Hedgehog signaling with Smo antagonists is beneficial to cancer patients with basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma. In this review, we provide an overview of Hedgehog pathway inhibitors with focusing on the preclinical and/or clinical efficacy and molecular mechanisms of these inhibitors.",Jeong In JI;Hyoung Rae HR;Haeil H;Sang Kyum SK;Jongkook J
22941430,Concurrent cyclophosphamide and craniospinal radiotherapy for pediatric high-risk embryonal brain tumors.,"Embryonal tumors are an aggressive subtype of high-grade, pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors often with dismal survival rates. The 5-year survival for highest-risk embryonal tumors may be as low as 10 %. We report feasibility and efficacy from our experience using intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide concurrently with craniospinal radiation (CSI) in high-risk embryonal CNS tumors of childhood. Ten consecutive children (aged: 3.5-15.5 years, median: 10.2 years, six male) with high-risk embryonal tumors, including: large cell/anaplastic medulloblastoma (6), atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (1), and leptomeningeal primitive neuroectodermal tumor (3), were treated with IV cyclophosphamide 1 g/M(2) on days 1 and 2 of CSI. Following a median of 36 Gy CSI plus tumor boosts, adjuvant treatment consisted of 21 doses of oral etoposide (7) and alkylator based chemotherapy from five to eight cycles in all. Of the ten patients thus treated, six remain alive with no evidence of disease and four are deceased. Median survival was 3.3 years, with a 3-year progression-free survival of 50 % (5/10). Median follow-up was: 3.3 years (range: 5 months-12.9 years) in the five patients with progression, median time-to-progression was: 1.3 years (range: 1 month-3 years). Median follow-up in the patients without progression is 8.8 years (range: 3-12.9 years). Complications due to adjuvant chemotherapy were typical and included myelosupression (10), necessitating shortened duration of chemotherapy in three, and hemorrhagic cystitis (1). In high-risk embryonal CNS tumors, cyclophosphamide given concurrently with CSI is well tolerated. Early results suggest that a phase II trial is warranted.",Cynthia J CJ;Joanna J;Sonia S;Patricia P;Iris C IC;Gary V GV;Paul Graham PG
22937732,Development of an early induction model of medulloblastoma in Ptch1 heterozygous mice initiated with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea.,"Mice heterozygous for the ptch1 gene (ptch1 mice) are known as a valuable model of medulloblastoma, a common brain tumor in children. To increase the incidence and reduce the time required for tumor development, allowing for evaluation of modifier effects on medulloblastoma in a short time, we attempted to develop an early induction model of medulloblastoma in ptch1 mice initiated with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). Ptch1 mice and their wild-type littermates received a single intraperitoneal injection of ENU (10, 50 or 100 mg/kg) on postnatal day 1 (d1) or 4 (d4), and histopathological assessment of brains was conducted at 12 weeks of age. The width of the external granular layer (EGL), a possible origin of medulloblastoma, after injection of 100 mg ENU on d1 or d4 was measured in up to 21-day-old mice. Cerebellar size was apparently reduced at the 50 mg dose and higher regardless of genotype. Microscopically, early lesions of medulloblastomas occurred with a high incidence only in ptch1 mice receiving 10 mg on d1 or d4, but a significant increase was not observed in other groups. Persistent EGL cells and misalignment of Purkinje cells were increased dose-dependently. Although EGL was strikingly decreased after ENU injection, strong recovery was observed in mice of the d1-treated group. In summary, neonatal treatment with ENU is available for the induction of medulloblastoma in ptch1 mice, and 10 mg of ENU administered on d1 appeared to be an appropriate dose to induce medulloblastoma.",Miwa M;Saori S;Kaoru K;Kei K;Kaoru K;Yukio Y;Midori M
27625820,"Protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1, -2, -3, -9 and -14) in Ewing family tumors and medulloblastomas of pediatric patients.","The matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are endopeptidases performing proteolytic functions in the extracellular matrix and their overexpression has been suggested to be a characteristic of malignant tumors. Molecular changes such as the presence of chimeric protein Ewing's sarcoma protein-friend leukemia virus integration 1 (EWS-FLI1) in the Ewing family of tumors (EFT) and the oncogenes C-ERBB-2, N-MYC, C-MYC in medulloblastoma (MB) promote the overexpression of MMP. In the present study, protein expression of MMP-1, -2, -3, -9 and -14 was qualitatively evaluated in 17 EFT and MB samples of children and adolescent by western blotting and optical densitometry, and the level of gene expression of some MMPs was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Five MB samples (45.4%) presented expression of the five MMPs and six samples (54.6%) presented expression of at least one of them. Four EFT samples (66.6%) presented expression of MMP-2, -9 and -14, and two samples (33.4%) presented expression of at least one of these MMPs, whereas the presence of MMP-1 and -3 was not observed. Gene analysis showed that MMP-2 had a high expression in MB, while the expression of MMP-9 and MMP-14 was higher in EFT. It has been established that the expression of the MMPs might be related to a complex pathway of gene regulation.",Elvis Cueva EC;Fabio José Nascimento FJ;Rosane Gomes de Paula RG;Carlos Alberto CA;Luiz Gonzaga LG
22937182,An interferon response gene expression signature is activated in a subset of medulloblastomas.,"Recent evidence suggests that cytomegalovirus infection contributes to the development of medulloblastomas. Differential activation of antiviral expression programs in medulloblastomas has not been investigated yet. In this study, we assess the relevance of an antiviral transcriptional response in medulloblastomas. We analyzed a gene expression signature of type I interferon response in three public gene expression data sets of medulloblastomas. Interferon response genes were found to be significantly coordinately regulated in two independent studies. We distilled a signature of 10 interferon response genes from two data sets. This signature exhibited strongly significant gene-versus-gene correlation of expression levels across samples in a third external medulloblastoma data set. Our medulloblastoma IFN signature identified a previously unrecognized patient subgroup partially overlapping the WNT and SHH subtypes proposed by others. We conclude that significant traces of differential activation of antiviral transcriptional response can be found in three independent medulloblastoma patient cohorts. This IFN activation signal often coincides with reduced proliferation scores. Our proposed 10-gene type I IFN response gene signature could help to assess antiviral states in further gene expression data sets of medulloblastomas or other cancers.",Eike E
22937156,Elevating SOX2 levels deleteriously affects the growth of medulloblastoma and glioblastoma cells.,"Medulloblastomas and glioblastomas are devastating tumors that respond poorly to treatment. These tumors have been shown to express SOX2 and overexpression of SOX2 has been correlated with poor prognosis. Although knockdown of SOX2 impairs the growth and tumorigenicity of brain tumor cells, it was unclear how elevating SOX2 levels would affect their fate. Interestingly, studies conducted with neural stem cells have shown that small increases or decreases in the level of this transcription factor significantly alter their fate. Here, we report that elevating SOX2 3-fold above endogenous levels in U87 and U118 glioblastoma, and DAOY medulloblastoma cells significantly impairs their ability to proliferate. We extended these findings and determined that elevating SOX2 in DAOY cells remodels their cell-cycle profile by increasing the proportion of cells in the G1-compartment, and induces the expression of genes associated with differentiation. Furthermore, we show that elevating SOX2 leads to a dramatic induction of CD133 expression in DAOY cells, yet inhibits the ability of both CD133(+) and CD133(-) cells to form neurospheres. Together, these findings argue that SOX2 levels must be carefully controlled in glioblastomas and medulloblastomas to maintain their fate. Equally important, our data suggests that increases in the expression of SOX2 during brain tumor progression are likely to be linked closely with changes in other critical genes that work in concert with SOX2 to enhance the tumorigenicity of brain tumors. Importantly, we demonstrate that this is also likely to be true for other cancers that express SOX2. Moreover, these studies demonstrate the advantage of using inducible promoters to study the effects of SOX2 elevation, as compared to gene expression systems that rely on constitutive expression.",Jesse L JL;Phillip J PJ;Michelle M;Angie A
22934045,Oncogenic extracellular vesicles in brain tumor progression.,"The brain is a frequent site of neoplastic growth, including both primary and metastatic tumors. The clinical intractability of many brain tumors and their distinct biology are implicitly linked to the unique microenvironment of the central nervous system (CNS) and cellular interactions within. Among the most intriguing forms of cellular interactions is that mediated by membrane-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Their biogenesis (vesiculation) and uptake by recipient cells serves as a unique mechanism of intercellular trafficking of complex biological messages including the exchange of molecules that cannot be released through classical secretory pathways, or that are prone to extracellular degradation. Tumor cells produce EVs containing molecular effectors of several cancer-related processes such as growth, invasion, drug resistance, angiogenesis, and coagulopathy. Notably, tumor-derived EVs (oncosomes) also contain oncogenic proteins, transcripts, DNA, and microRNA (miR). Uptake of this material may change properties of the recipient cells and impact the tumor microenvironment. Examples of transformation-related molecules found in the cargo of tumor-derived EVs include the oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII), tumor suppressors (PTEN), and oncomirs (miR-520g). It is postulated that EVs circulating in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of brain tumor patients may be used to decipher molecular features (mutations) of the underlying malignancy, reflect responses to therapy, or molecular subtypes of primary brain tumors [e.g., glioma or medulloblastoma (MB)]. It is possible that metastases to the brain may also emit EVs with clinically relevant oncogenic signatures. Thus, EVs emerge as a novel and functionally important vehicle of intercellular communication that can mediate multiple biological effects. In addition, they provide a unique platform to develop molecular biomarkers in brain malignancies.",Esterina E;Delphine D;Tae H TH;Laura L;Brian B;Janusz J
22929883,WNT/β-catenin pathway activation in Myc immortalised cerebellar progenitor cells inhibits neuronal differentiation and generates tumours resembling medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant childhood brain tumour. Aberrant activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway occurs in approximately 25% of medulloblastomas. However, its role in medulloblastoma pathogenesis is not understood. We have developed a model of WNT/β-catenin pathway-activated medulloblastoma. Pathway activation was induced in a Myc immortalised cerebellar progenitor cell line through stable expression of Wnt1. In vitro and in vivo analysis was undertaken to understand the effect of pathway activation and identify the potential cell of origin. Tumours that histologically resembled classical medulloblastoma formed in vivo using cells overexpressing Wnt1, but not with the control cell line. Wnt1 overexpression inhibited neuronal differentiation in vitro, suggesting WNT/β-catenin pathway activation prevents cells terminally differentiating, maintaining them in a more 'stem-like' state. Analysis of cerebellar progenitor cell markers demonstrated the cell line resembled cells from the cerebellar ventricular zone. We have developed a cell line with the means of orthotopically modelling WNT/β-catenin pathway-activated medulloblastoma. We provide evidence of the role pathway activation is playing in tumour pathogenesis and suggest medulloblastomas can arise from cells other than granule cell progenitors. This cell line is a valuable resource to further understand the role of pathway activation in tumorigenesis and for investigation of targeted therapies.",H A HA;S S;C C;E E;B B;R G RG
22924302,The results of treatment of primary brain tumors in children.,"During the period of 2009-2011 in UCH in Belgrade, we treated 22 patients with brain tumors. Treatment included the diagnosis and therapy that included surgery and postoperative neuroradiological follow-up of all patients regardless of whether radiotherapy was conducted with or without chemotherapy. The most frequent were low grade astrocytomas and medulloblastomas. Patients with supratentorial localization of tumor had significantly smaller neurological sequelae compared with patients with infratentorial as well as patients diagnosed with low grade astrocytomas of any localization. From 10 patients with supratentorial localization, 7 of them had no neurological deficit, while from 11 patients with infratentorial localization, 3 of them were Without deficit. Patients with histological diagnosis of low grade astrocytoma of any localization had less neurological deficits compared with other tumors. From 7 low grade astrocytoma in 5 of them there was no neurological deficit, while only in one patient residual tumor was verified. In 7 patients the rest of the tumor was diagnosed, while in 14 patients no residual tumors was diagnosed during follow-up based on the MRI diagnosis. Surgery, postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy in some cases represent an effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of brain tumors in children.",Milan M;Miljan M;Igor I;Nikola N;Vladimir V;Vuk V;Aleksandar A;Ivan I;Branislav B;Goran G
22923130,Response to inhibition of smoothened in diverse epithelial cancer cells that lack smoothened or patched 1 mutations.,"Hedgehog (HH) pathway Smoothened (Smo) inhibitors are active against Gorlin syndrome-associated basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and medulloblastoma where Patched (Ptch) mutations occur. We interrogated 705 epithelial cancer cell lines for growth response to the Smo inhibitor cyclopamine and for expressed HH pathway-regulated species in a linked genetic database. Ptch and Smo mutations that respectively conferred Smo inhibitor response or resistance were undetected. Previous studies revealed HH pathway activation in lung cancers. Therefore, findings were validated using lung cancer cell lines, transgenic and transplantable murine lung cancer models, and human normal-malignant lung tissue arrays in addition to testing other Smo inhibitors. Cyclopamine sensitivity most significantly correlated with high cyclin E (P=0.000009) and low insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6) (P=0.000004) levels. Gli family members were associated with response. Cyclopamine resistance occurred with high GILZ (P=0.002) expression. Newer Smo inhibitors exhibited a pattern of sensitivity similar to cyclopamine. Gain of cyclin E or loss of IGFBP6 in lung cancer cells significantly increased Smo inhibitor response. Cyclin E-driven transgenic lung cancers expressed a gene profile implicating HH pathway activation. Cyclopamine treatment significantly reduced proliferation of murine and human lung cancers. Smo inhibition reduced lung cancer formation in a syngeneic mouse model. In human normal-malignant lung tissue arrays cyclin E, IGFBP6, Gli1 and GILZ were each differentially expressed. Together, these findings indicate that Smo inhibitors should be considered in cancers beyond those with activating HH pathway mutations. This includes tumors that express genes indicating basal HH pathway activation.",Fabrizio F;Alexander M AM;Fadzai F;Tian T;David D;Vincent A VA;Konstantin H KH;Fang F;Kevin C KC;Yongli Y;Sarah J SJ;Angeline S AS;Patricia P;David J DJ;Jeff J;Cyril C;Ethan E
22922085,Camel urine components display anti-cancer properties in vitro.,"While camel urine (CU) is widely used in the Arabian Peninsula to treat various diseases, including cancer, its exact mechanism of action is still not defined. The objective of the present study is to investigate whether camel urine has anti-cancer effect on human cells in vitro. The annexinV/PI assay was used to assess apoptosis, and immunoblotting analysis determined the effect of CU on different apoptotic and oncogenic proteins. Furthermore, flow cytometry and Elispot were utilized to investigate cytotoxicity and the effect on the cell cycle as well as the production of cytokines, respectively. Camel urine showed cytotoxicity against various, but not all, human cancer cell lines, with only marginal effect on non-tumorigenic epithelial and normal fibroblast cells epithelial and fibroblast cells. Interestingly, 216 mg/ml of lyophilized CU inhibited cell proliferation and triggered more than 80% of apoptosis in different cancer cells, including breast carcinomas and medulloblastomas. Apoptosis was induced in these cells through the intrinsic pathway via Bcl-2 decrease. Furthermore, CU down-regulated the cancer-promoting proteins survivin, β-catenin and cyclin D1 and increased the level of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. In addition, we have shown that CU has no cytotoxic effect against peripheral blood mononuclear cells and has strong immuno-inducer activity through inducing IFN-γ and inhibiting the Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10. CU has specific and efficient anti-cancer and potent immune-modulator properties in vitro.",Nujoud N;Ameera A;Basem B;Ibrahim I;Khaled K;Abdelilah A
22915472,Outcome of primary childhood central nervous system tumors: results from a single center in Iran.,"Childhood primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancies are one of the most important concerns in pediatric oncology. In this historical cohort, 82 patients treated in Ali-Asghar Children's Hospital between 1996 and 2005 were evaluated for age, gender, type of treatment, tumor pathology, and survival. The records of 38 female (46.3%) and 44 male (53.7%) patients were included. The mean age was 6.8 ± 3.39 years (6 months to 14 years); the frequency of medulloblastoma was significantly more than others (p = 0.012). Complete resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were done in 47.5, 82.9, and 97.56%, respectively. Estimated 5 years overall and event-free survivals (EFSs) were approximately 68.5 and 35%, respectively. The patients with complete resected tumors had significantly better outcome (p = 0.013). Also, low-grade versus high-grade astrocytoma was significantly a better outcome (p = 0.01). The poor EFS with consideration of high number of progressive disease among our patients (50% unresectable tumor) suggests that children in Iran with CNS tumors had high quality of care but availability of advanced treatment protocol and sharing of cooperative trial study is essential for survival improvement. In addition to use more advanced methods and equipments of radiotherapy and chemotherapeutic drugs, we should seriously consider development of better surgical techniques to increase the rate of complete resection of malignant CNS tumors.",Kh Arjmandi KhA;Gr G;F F;P P

22911853,Confocal laser endomicroscopy for diagnosis and histomorphologic imaging of brain tumors in vivo.,"Early detection and evaluation of brain tumors during surgery is crucial for accurate resection. Currently cryosections during surgery are regularly performed. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a novel technique permitting in vivo histologic imaging with miniaturized endoscopic probes at excellent resolution. Aim of the current study was to evaluate CLE for in vivo diagnosis in different types and models of intracranial neoplasia. In vivo histomorphology of healthy brains and two different C6 glioma cell line allografts was evaluated in rats. One cell line expressed EYFP, the other cell line was used for staining with fluorescent dyes (fluorescein, acriflavine, FITC-dextran and Indocyanine green). To evaluate future application in patients, fresh surgical resection specimen of human intracranial tumors (n = 15) were examined (glioblastoma multiforme, meningioma, craniopharyngioma, acoustic neurinoma, brain metastasis, medulloblastoma, epidermoid tumor). Healthy brain tissue adjacent to the samples served as control. CLE yielded high-quality histomorphology of normal brain tissue and tumors. Different fluorescent agents revealed distinct aspects of tissue and cell structure (nuclear pattern, axonal pathways, hemorrhages). CLE discrimination of neoplastic from healthy brain tissue was easy to perform based on tissue and cellular architecture and resemblance with histopathology was excellent. Confocal laser endomicroscopy allows immediate in vivo imaging of normal and neoplastic brain tissue at high resolution. The technology might be transferred to scientific and clinical application in neurosurgery and neuropathology. It may become helpful to screen for tumor free margins and to improve the surgical resection of malignant brain tumors, and opens the door to in vivo molecular imaging of tumors and other neurologic disorders.",Sebastian S;Axel A;Ali A;Gilles A GA;Luise L;Konstantin K;Ralf R;Oliver O;Martin M;Patra P

The craniospinal axis received a median of 30 Gy (range 23.4-39.6 Gy) in fractions of 1.6-2 Gy/day, and the tumor was boosted to a total median dose of 50 Gy (range 50-55.25 Gy). The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates for all patients were 45% and 50%, respectively. In univariate analysis, Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) > 70, neurologic symptoms duration > 30 days, lateral tumor location, standard risk patients, no hydrocephalus, radiotherapy (RT) treatment field (CSI + brain boost), and CSI dose ≥ 30 Gy were associated with better DFS. Standard-risk patients, RT treatment field (CSI + brain boost), and CSI dose ≥ 30 Gy were also significantly associated with better OS. The combined modality treatment results in a favorable outcome for adult medulloblastoma patients. Further investigation of the prognostic factors, radiation-related factors, and systemic chemotherapy is needed.",S-F SF;C-W CW;Y-H YH;K-H KH;J C-H JC;A-L AL;S-H SH
22910224,"Discovery of pyrrolo[3,2-c]quinoline-4-one derivatives as novel hedgehog signaling inhibitors.","The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays a significant role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation during embryonic development. Since activation of the Hh signaling pathway is implicated in several types of human cancers, inhibitors of this pathway could be promising anticancer agents. Using high throughput screening, thieno[3,2-c]quinoline-4-one derivative 9a was identified as a compound of interest with potent in vitro activity but poor metabolic stability. Our efforts focused on enhancement of in vitro inhibitory activity and metabolic stability, including core ring conversion and side chain optimization. This led to the discovery of pyrrolo[3,2-c]quinoline-4-one derivative 12b, which has a structure distinct from previously reported Hh signaling inhibitors. Compound 12b suppressed stromal Gli1 mRNA expression in a murine model and demonstrated antitumor activity in a murine medulloblastoma allograft model.",Tomohiro T;Yuya Y;Toshio T;Zenyu Z;Sachio S;Yoshihiko Y;Hiroko H;Harumi H;Yukiko Y;Shigeru S;Maki M;Hideaki H;Atsuo A;Satoshi S
22910179,Targeting Hedgehog signaling and understanding refractory response to treatment with Hedgehog pathway inhibitors.,"Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is a principal component of the morphogenetic code best known to direct pattern formation during embryogenesis. The Hh pathway remains active in adulthood however where it guides tissue regeneration and remodeling and Hh production in the niche plays an important role in maintaining stem cell compartment size. Deregulated Hh signaling activity is associated, depending on the context, with both cancer initiation and progression. Interestingly, the Hh pathway is remarkably druggable, raising hopes that inhibition of the pathway could support anticancer therapy. Indeed, a large body of preclinical data supports such an action, but promising clinical data are still limited to basal cell carcinoma (BSC) and medulloblastoma. Nevertheless cancer resistance against Hh targeting has already emerged as a major problem. Here we shall review the current situation with respect to targeting the Hh pathway in cancer in general and in chemotolerance in particular with a focus on the problems associated with the emergence of tumors resistant to treatment with inhibitors targeting the Hh receptor Smoothened (SMO).",Karla C S KC;C Arnold CA;Maikel P MP
22907436,Direct effects of Bmi1 on p53 protein stability inactivates oncoprotein stress responses in embryonal cancer precursor cells at tumor initiation.,"Embryonal cancer can arise from postnatally persistent embryonal remnant or rest cells, which are uniquely characterized by the absence of p53 mutations. Perinatal overexpression of the MycN oncoprotein in embryonal cancer precursor cells causes postnatal rests, and later tumor formation through unknown mechanisms. However, overexpression of Myc in adult tissues normally activates apoptosis and/or senescence signals as an organismal defense mechanism against cancer. Here, we show that perinatal neuroblastoma precursor cells exhibited a transiently diminished p53 response to MycN oncoprotein stress and resistance to trophic factor withdrawal, compared with their adult counterpart cells from the TH-MYCN(+/+) transgenic mouse model of neuroblastoma. The adult stem cell maintenance factor and Polycomb group protein, Bmi1 (B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site), had a critical role at neuroblastoma initiation in the model, by repressing p53 responses in precursor cells. We further show in neuroblastoma tumor cells that Bmi1 could directly bind p53 in a complex with other Polycomb complex proteins, Ring1A or Ring1B, leading to increased p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Repressed p53 signal responses were also seen in precursor cells for other embryonal cancer types, medulloblastoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Collectively, these date indicate a general mechanism for p53 inactivation in some embryonal cell types and consequent susceptibility to MycN oncogenesis at the point of embryonal tumor initiation.",M M;E O EO;H J HJ;B B BB;W D WD;J J;J B JB;A A;K K;N P NP;M V MV;B B;O O;T T;M D MD;M M;E S ES;J M JM;T N TN;T T;B J BJ;H F HF;G M GM
22906929,Prevailing importance of the hedgehog signaling pathway and the potential for treatment advancement in sarcoma.,"The hedgehog signaling pathway is important in embryogenesis and post natal development. Constitutive activation of the pathway due to mutation of pathway components occurs in ~25% of medulloblastomas and also in basal cell carcinomas. In many other malignancies the therapeutic role for hedgehog inhibition though intriguing, based on preclinical data, is far from assured. Hedgehog inhibition is not an established part of the treatment paradigm of sarcoma but the scientific rationale for a possible benefit is compelling. In chondrosarcoma there is evidence of hedgehog pathway activation and an ontologic comparison between growth plate chondrocyte differentiation and different chondrosarcoma subtypes. Immunostaining epiphyseal growth plate for Indian hedgehog is particularly positive in the zone of pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes which correlates ontologically with conventional chondrosarcoma. In Ewing sarcoma/PNET tumors the Gli1 transcription factor is a direct target of the EWS-FLI1 oncoprotein present in 85% of cases. In many cases of rhabdomyosarcomas there is increased expression of Gli1 (Ragazzini et al., 2004). Additionally, a third of embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas have loss of Chr.9q22 that encompasses the patched locus (Bridge et al., 2000). The potential to treat osteosarcoma by inhibition of Gli2 and the role of the pathway in ovarian fibromas and other connective tissue tumors is also discussed (Nagao et al., 2011; Hirotsu et al., 2010). Emergence of acquired secondary resistance to targeted therapeutics is an important issue that is also relevant to hedgehog inhibition. In this context secondary resistance of medulloblastomas to treatment with a smoothened antagonist in two tumor mouse models is examined.",Fergal C FC;Jason E JE;Joan M JM;D Neil DN;David M DM

22904683,Identification of cell surface targets through meta-analysis of microarray data.,"High-resolution image guidance for resection of residual tumor cells would enable more precise and complete excision for more effective treatment of cancers, such as medulloblastoma, the most common pediatric brain cancer. Numerous studies have shown that brain tumor patient outcomes correlate with the precision of resection. To enable guided resection with molecular specificity and cellular resolution, molecular probes that effectively delineate brain tumor boundaries are essential. Therefore, we developed a bioinformatics approach to analyze micro-array datasets for the identification of transcripts that encode candidate cell surface biomarkers that are highly enriched in medulloblastoma. The results identified 380 genes with greater than a two-fold increase in the expression in the medulloblastoma compared with that in the normal cerebellum. To enrich for targets with accessibility for extracellular molecular probes, we further refined this list by filtering it with gene ontology to identify genes with protein localization on, or within, the plasma membrane. To validate this meta-analysis, the top 10 candidates were evaluated with immunohistochemistry. We identified two targets, fibrillin 2 and EphA3, which specifically stain medulloblastoma. These results demonstrate a novel bioinformatics approach that successfully identified cell surface and extracellular candidate markers enriched in medulloblastoma versus adjacent cerebellum. These two proteins are high-value targets for the development of tumor-specific probes in medulloblastoma. This bioinformatics method has broad utility for the identification of accessible molecular targets in a variety of cancers and will enable probe development for guided resection.",Henry H;Joel T JT;Jonathan T C JT;Atul J AJ;Christopher H CH

However, the PK evaluation of 1 at high dosage (100 mg/kg) revealed the C(max) value 3.63 μg/mL, likely due to poor solubility of this compound. Efforts to improve solubility by reducing the aromatic ring count of the core system led to N-methylpyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridine derivative 11. Further optimization of the 3-alkoxy group led to compound 11d with acceptable solubility and potent Hh inhibitory activity. Compound 11d suppressed transcription factor Gli1 mRNA expression in tumor-associated stromal tissue and inhibited tumor growth (treatment/control ratio, 3%) in a mouse medulloblastoma allograft model owing to the improved PK profile based on increased solubility.

A retrospective review of 313 histopathologically proven brain tumours over an 11-year period has been performed at the Children's Hospital Westmead, New South Wales, Australia, to determine proportions and locations of different tumours, age distribution, survival rates and usage of various treatment modalities. Pilocytic astrocytoma was the most common paediatric brain tumour (29%) followed by medulloblastoma (12%) and ependymoma (6%). Most tumours were histologically benign (59%), and 42% of tumours were located in the posterior fossa. The average age at diagnosis was 7.9 years. About 50% of children were treated with surgery alone, whereas the other 50% had surgery or biopsy plus adjuvant treatment. The overall one-year survival rate was 89% and the five-year survival rate was 80%. The five-year survival rates for pilocytic astrocytoma was 91%; medulloblastoma, 75%; ependymoma, 82%; and high grade glioma, 15%. Thus, a large proportion of paediatric brain tumours were histologically benign and were treated with surgery alone, but a subset of benign tumours required adjuvant treatment and were associated with mortality (25%). The overall survival rates were high and are improving, although for some tumours, such as high grade glioma, the outlook remains poor.",Mahesh M;Raymond R

While an ongoing improvement in overall prognosis has been achieved in the last few decades, current therapeutic approaches still confer significant morbidities, especially for the very young. The traditional strategies of surgery, radiotherapy and conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy need to be further refined while newer approaches, including molecularly targeted agents, hold the promise of better responses, improved outcomes and reduced toxicities. This article discusses treatment standards, the focus of current clinical investigations and the future promise of novel, biologically based approaches for the most common pediatric CNS tumors: primitive neuroectodermal tumors including medulloblastomas, ependymomas and astrocytomas (both low-grade and high-grade glioma).",John A JA;Stergios S;Mark W MW
22893378,Metastatic medulloblastoma in an adolescent with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome.,"We describe the case of a 12-year-old Hispanic male with a clinical and molecular diagnosis of Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) who subsequently developed metastatic medulloblastoma. While individuals with SGBS have been documented to have increased risk for intra-abdominal tumors such as Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma, medulloblastomas, or CNS tumors in general, have not been reported in patients with this syndrome. Our patient was clinically diagnosed with SGBS as an infant. He presented with many of the common features of the syndrome, such as cleft palate, macroglossia, post-axial polydactyly, ""coarse"" facial features, and ventricular septal defects (VSDs). Molecular testing performed in April 2009 confirmed the SGBS diagnosis. This testing detected a large intragenic deletion in the GPC3 gene (more than 500 kb, 8 exons) extending from intron 2, 37 kb downstream of exon 2, to the 5' end of the gene, deleting exons 1 and 2. However, subsequent testing by gene-centric high-density array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) detected a deletion encompassing only exon 2. Therefore, the exact 5' boundary of the deletion cannot currently be determined, due to an apparent complex rearrangement upstream of exon 1. We present this case of metastatic medulloblastoma as a unique malignancy in a patient with SGBS.",Martha M;Victoria V;Robert R;Shafqat S;Thomas T;Marwan M;Elizabeth E
22887866,A statin-regulated microRNA represses human c-Myc expression and function.,"c-Myc dysregulation is one of the most common abnormalities found in human cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are functionally intertwined with the c-Myc network as multiple miRNAs are regulated by c-Myc, while others directly suppress c-Myc expression. In this work, we identified miR-33b as a primate-specific negative regulator of c-Myc. The human miR-33b gene is located at 17p11.2, a genomic locus frequently lost in medulloblastomas, of which a subset displays c-Myc overproduction. Through a small-scale screening with drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we found that lovastatin upregulated miR-33b expression, reduced cell proliferation and impaired c-Myc expression and function in miR-33b-positive medulloblastoma cells. In addition, a low dose of lovastatin treatment at a level comparable to approved human oral use reduced tumour growth in mice orthotopically xenografted with cells carrying miR-33b, but not with cells lacking miR-33b. This work presents a highly promising therapeutic option, using drug repurposing and a miRNA as a biomarker, against cancers that overexpress c-Myc.",Apana A L AA;Yan Y;Lindsey E LE;Jingwen J;Saibyasachi S;Ae Kyung AK;Mofang M;Ken H KH;Woong-Yang WY;Robert C G RC;Yong Y
22886824,Classification of single-voxel 1H spectra of childhood cerebellar tumors using LCModel and whole tissue representations.,"In this study, mean tumor spectra are used as the basis functions in LCModel to create a direct classification tool for short echo time (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy of pediatric brain tumors. LCModel is a widely used analysis tool designed to fit a linear combination of individual metabolite spectra to in vivo spectra. Here, we have used LCModel to fit mean spectra and corresponding variability components of childhood cerebellar tumors, as calculated using principal component analysis, and assessed for classification accuracy. Classification was performed according to the highest estimated tumor proportion. This method was tested in a leave-one-out analysis discriminating between pediatric brain tumor spectra of medulloblastoma vs. pilocytic astrocytoma and medulloblastoma vs. pilocytic astrocytoma vs. ependymoma. Additionally, the effect of accepting different Cramér-Rao Lower Bound cut-off criteria on classification accuracy and estimated tissue proportions was investigated. The best classification results differentiating medulloblastoma vs. pilocytic astrocytoma and medulloblastoma vs. pilocytic astrocytoma vs. ependymoma were 100 and 87.7%, respectively. These results are comparable to a specialized pattern recognition analysis of this data set and give easy to interpret results in the form of estimated tissue proportions. The method requires minimal user input and is easily transferable across sites and to other magnetic resonance spectroscopy classification problems.",Felix F;Nigel P NP;Martin M;Andrew C AC;Franklyn A FA
22886512,Prognostic value of the TP53 Arg72Pro single-nucleotide polymorphism and susceptibility to medulloblastoma in a cohort of Brazilian patients.,"Medulloblastoma is a highly cellular malignant embryonal neoplasm, being the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, accounting for 20-25 % of pediatric central nervous system tumors. To investigate the effect of the TP53 Arg72Pro single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on clinicopathological and phenotypic parameters, we performed a case-controlled study of 122 patients and 122 healthy controls from Brazil. No significant associations were found between the TP53 Arg72Pro genotypes and the clinicopathological parameters studied. Compared with Arg/Arg, which is the most common genotype in the study population, both the Arg/Pro and Pro/Pro genotypes did not influence the medulloblastoma development risk [odds ratio (OR) = 1.36 and P = 0.339 for the Arg/Pro genotype; OR = 1.50 and P = 0.389 for the Pro/Pro genotype]. With regard to prognosis, disease-free survival was not significantly different among the TP53 Arg72Pro SNP genotypes (P > 0.05), but the less frequent genotype (Pro/Pro) was associated with shorter overall survival of medulloblastoma patients (P = 0.021). These data suggest that, although there is no association between the TP53 Arg72Pro SNP and medulloblastoma risk, the Pro/Pro genotype is associated with shorter overall survival of patients submitted to adjuvant therapy. Nevertheless, due to the interethnic composition of the Brazilian population, future studies on larger populations from other parts of the world are essential for a definitive conclusion on the function of the TP53 Arg72Pro SNP.",Raimundo M RM;Giovanny R GR;France K N FK;Patrícia D L PD;Carolina R T CR;Adriana C AC;Letícia M LM;Juan A JA;Rommel R RR
22875024,Functional genomics identifies drivers of medulloblastoma dissemination.,"Medulloblastomas are malignant brain tumors that arise in the cerebellum in children and disseminate via the cerebrospinal fluid to the leptomeningeal spaces of the brain and spinal cord. Challenged by the poor prognosis for patients with metastatic dissemination, pediatric oncologists have developed aggressive treatment protocols, combining surgery, craniospinal radiation, and high-dose chemotherapy, that often cause disabling neurotoxic effects in long-term survivors. Insights into the genetic control of medulloblastoma dissemination have come from transposon insertion mutagenesis studies. Mobilizing the Sleeping Beauty transposon in cerebellar neural progenitor cells caused widespread dissemination of typically nonmetastatic medulloblastomas in Patched(+/-) mice, in which Shh signaling is hyperactive. Candidate metastasis genes were identified by sequencing the insertion sites and then mapping these sequences back to the mouse genome. To determine whether genes located at transposon insertion sites directly caused medulloblastomas to disseminate, we overexpressed candidate genes in Nestin(+) neural progenitors in the cerebella of mice by retroviral transfer in combination with Shh. We show here that ectopic expression of Eras, Lhx1, Ccrk, and Akt shifted the in vivo growth characteristics of Shh-induced medulloblastomas from a localized pattern to a disseminated pattern in which tumor cells seeded the leptomeningeal spaces of the brain and spinal cord.",Michael M;Adrian A;Xiaochong X;Paul A PA;Steven S SS;Carolyn A CA;Michael D MD;Daniel W DW
22869526,A distinct Smoothened mutation causes severe cerebellar developmental defects and medulloblastoma in a novel transgenic mouse model.,"Deregulated developmental processes in the cerebellum cause medulloblastoma, the most common pediatric brain malignancy. About 25 to 30% of cases are caused by mutations increasing the activity of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway, a critical mitogen in cerebellar development. The proto-oncogene Smoothened (Smo) is a key transducer of the Shh pathway. Activating mutations in Smo that lead to constitutive activity of the Shh pathway have been identified in human medulloblastoma. To understand the developmental and oncogenic effects of two closely positioned point mutations in Smo, we characterized NeuroD2-SmoA2 mice and compared them to NeuroD2-SmoA1 mice. While both SmoA1 and SmoA2 transgenes cause medulloblastoma with similar frequencies and timing, SmoA2 mice have severe aberrations in cerebellar development, whereas SmoA1 mice are largely normal during development. Intriguingly, neurologic function, as measured by specific tests, is normal in the SmoA2 mice despite extensive cerebellar dysplasia. We demonstrate how two nearly contiguous point mutations in the same domain of the encoded Smo protein can produce striking phenotypic differences in cerebellar development and organization in mice.",Joyoti J;Sally S;Sue E SE;Beryl A BA;Janell M JM;Michele A MA;Brig B;Lucy B LB;James M JM
22855790,Voltage-gated potassium channel EAG2 controls mitotic entry and tumor growth in medulloblastoma via regulating cell volume dynamics.,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common pediatric CNS malignancy. We identify EAG2 as an overexpressed potassium channel in MBs across different molecular and histological subgroups. EAG2 knockdown not only impairs MB cell growth in vitro, but also reduces tumor burden in vivo and enhances survival in xenograft studies. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that EAG2 protein is confined intracellularly during interphase but is enriched in the plasma membrane during late G2 phase and mitosis. Disruption of EAG2 expression results in G2 arrest and mitotic catastrophe associated with failure of premitotic cytoplasmic condensation. While the tumor suppression function of EAG2 knockdown is independent of p53 activation, DNA damage checkpoint activation, or changes in the AKT pathway, this defective cell volume control is specifically associated with hyperactivation of the p38 MAPK pathway. Inhibition of the p38 pathway significantly rescues the growth defect and G2 arrest. Strikingly, ectopic membrane expression of EAG2 in cells at interphase results in cell volume reduction and mitotic-like morphology. Our study establishes the functional significance of EAG2 in promoting MB tumor progression via regulating cell volume dynamics, the perturbation of which activates the tumor suppressor p38 MAPK pathway, and provides clinical relevance for targeting this ion channel in human MBs.",Xi X;Adrian M AM;Rintaro R;Jim J;Ye Y;Ji J;Chin C;Michael K MK;Paul A PA;Michael D MD;Michael J MJ;Tarik T;Justin J;Christopher S CS;William A WA;C David CD;David H DH;Marc A MA;Yuh Nung YN;Lily Yeh LY

22851568,Induction chemotherapy and conformal radiation therapy for very young children with nonmetastatic medulloblastoma: Children's Oncology Group study P9934.,"P9934 was a prospective trial of systemic chemotherapy, second surgery, and conformal radiation therapy (CRT) limited to the posterior fossa and primary site for children between 8 months and 3 years old with nonmetastatic medulloblastoma. The study was open from June 2000 until June 2006. After initial surgery, children received four cycles of induction chemotherapy, followed by age- and response-adjusted CRT to the posterior fossa (18 or 23.4 Gy) and tumor bed (cumulative 50.4 or 54 Gy) and maintenance chemotherapy. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were evaluated and event-free survival (EFS) results were directly compared with a previous study of multiagent chemotherapy without irradiation (Pediatric Oncology Group [POG] trial 9233). Seventy-four patients met eligibility requirements. The 4-year EFS and overall survival probabilities were 50% ± 6% and 69% ± 5.5%, respectively, which compared favorably to the results from POG 9233. Analysis showed that the desmoplastic/nodular subtype was a favorable factor in predicting survival. Our 4-year EFS rate was 58% ± 8% for patients with desmoplasia. Whereas seven of 10 patients who had disease progression before CRT had primary-site failure, 15 of 19 patients who progressed after CRT had distant-site failure. Neurodevelopmental assessments did not show a decline in cognitive or motor function after protocol-directed chemotherapy and CRT. The addition of CRT to postoperative chemotherapy in young children with nonmetastatic medulloblastoma increased event-free survival compared with the use of postoperative chemotherapy alone. Future studies will use histopathologic typing (desmoplastic/nodular versus nondesmoplastic/nodular) to stratify patients for therapy by risk of relapse.",David M DM;Thomas E TE;Douglas D;Tianni T;Patricia P;Peter C PC;Douglas C DC;Nancy N;Melanie J MJ;Michael M;Allen A;Russell R;Larry E LE;Lee L;Ian F IF

In all, 340 children age 4 to 21 years from 122 European centers were postoperatively staged and randomly assigned to treatment with hyperfractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) or standard (conventional) fractionated radiotherapy (STRT) followed by a common chemotherapy regimen consisting of eight cycles of cisplatin, lomustine, and vincristine. After a median follow-up of 4.8 years (range, 0.1 to 8.3 years), survival rates were not significantly different between the two treatment arms: 5-year EFS was 77% ± 4% in the STRT group and 78% ± 4% in the HFRT group; corresponding 5-year OS was 87% ± 3% and 85% ± 3%, respectively. A postoperative residual tumor of more than 1.5 cm(2) was the strongest negative prognostic factor. EFS of children with all reference assessments and no large residual tumor was 82% ± 2% at 5 years. Patients with a delay of more than 7 weeks to the start of RT had a worse prognosis. Severe hearing loss was not significantly different for the two treatment arms at follow-up. In this large randomized European study, which enrolled patients with standard-risk medulloblastoma from more than 100 centers, excellent survival rates were achieved in patients without a large postoperative residual tumor and without RT treatment delays. EFS and OS for HFRT was not superior to STRT, which therefore remains standard of care in this disease.",Birgitta B;Stefan S;Francois F;Barry B;Göran G;Aurora A;Maura M;Roel R;Martin M;Christian C;Roger R;Lorenza L;Thomas T;Jordi J;Foppe F;Torsten T;Dominique D;Keith K;Marco M;Steven C SC;Monica M;Katja K;Andreas A;Véronique V;Rolf R
22851551,The utility of hedgehog signaling pathway inhibition for cancer.,"The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has been implicated in tumor initiation and metastasis across different malignancies. Major mechanisms by which the Hh pathway is aberrantly activated can be attributed to mutations of members of Hh pathway or excessive/inappropriate expression of Hh pathway ligands. The Hh signaling pathway also affects the regulation of cancer stem cells, leading to their capabilities in tumor formation, disease progression, and metastasis. Preliminary results of early phase clinical trials of Hh inhibitors administered as monotherapy demonstrated promising results in patients with basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma, but clinically meaningful anticancer efficacy across other tumor types seems to be lacking. Additionally, cases of resistance have been already observed. Mutations of SMO, activation of Hh pathway components downstream to SMO, and upregulation of alternative signaling pathways are possible mechanisms of resistance development. Determination of effective Hh inhibitor-based combination regimens and development of correlative biomarkers relevant to this pathway should remain as clear priorities for future research.",Solmaz S;Lillian L LL;Albiruni A AA
22848702,Medulloblastoma exosome proteomics yield functional roles for extracellular vesicles.,"Medulloblastomas are the most prevalent malignant pediatric brain tumors. Survival for these patients has remained largely the same for approximately 20 years, and our therapies for these cancers cause significant health, cognitive, behavioral and developmental sequelae for those who survive the tumor and their treatments. We obviously need a better understanding of the biology of these tumors, particularly with regard to their migratory/invasive behaviors, their proliferative propensity, and their abilities to deflect immune responses. Exosomes, virus-sized membrane vesicles released extracellularly from cells after formation in, and transit thru, the endosomal pathway, may play roles in medulloblastoma pathogenesis but are as yet unstudied in this disease. Here we characterized exosomes from a medulloblastoma cell line with biochemical and proteomic analyses, and included characterization of patient serum exosomes. Further scrutiny of the proteomic data suggested functional properties of the exosomes that are relevant to medulloblastoma tumor biology, including their roles as proliferation stimulants, their activities as attractants for tumor cell migration, and their immune modulatory impacts on lymphocytes. Aspects of this held true for exosomes from other medulloblastoma cell lines as well. Additionally, pathway analyses suggested a possible role for the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A); however, inhibition of the protein's activity actually increased D283MED cell proliferation/clonogenecity, suggesting that HNF4A may act as a tumor suppressor in this cell line. Our work demonstrates that relevant functional properties of exosomes may be derived from appropriate proteomic analyses, which translate into mechanisms of tumor pathophysiology harbored in these extracellular vesicles.",Laura M LM;Steve G SG;Anjelika M AM;Nathaniel L NL;Jason J;Rodney J RJ;Thomas J TJ;Lynne T LT;Michael W MW
22848092,REST is a novel prognostic factor and therapeutic target for medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma is a malignant pediatric brain tumor. Current treatment following patient stratification into standard and high-risk groups using clinical features has improved survival. However, a subset of patients with standard risk features have unanticipated aggressive disease, underscoring the need for a better understanding of tumor biology and the development of novel treatments. Poor differentiation, a hallmark of medulloblastomas is associated with elevated expression levels of the repressor of neuronal differentiation called repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST). Here, we assessed whether elevated REST expression levels had prognostic significance and whether its pharmacologic manipulation would promote neurogenesis and block tumor cell growth. REST levels in patient tumors were measured by immunohistochemistry and stratified into negative, low/moderate- (+/++/+++), and high-REST (+++++) groups. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that patients with high-REST tumors had worse overall and event-free survival compared with patients with REST-negative or REST-low tumors. Because histone deacetylases (HDAC) are required for REST-dependent repression of neurogenesis, we evaluated a panel of HDAC inhibitors (HDACI) for their effects on growth and differentiation of established and primary REST-positive cell lines. MS-275, trichostatin-A (TSA), valproic acid (VPA), and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) upregulated expression of the REST-target neuronal differentiation gene, Syn1, suggesting a potential effect of these HDACIs on REST function. Interestingly, VPA and TSA substantially increased histone acetylation at the REST promoter and activated its transcription, whereas SAHA unexpectedly promoted its proteasomal degradation. A REST-dependent decrease in cell growth was also observed following SAHA treatment. Thus, our studies suggest that HDACIs may have therapeutic potential for patients with REST-positive tumors.

Recent studies have implicated sonic hedgehog (SHH) and insulin growth factor (IGF) as important mediators in deregulated pathways, which directly inactivate tuberous sclerosis complex, leading to activation of the serine/threonine kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR consists of two catalytic subunits of biochemically distinct complexes called mTORC1 and mTORC2. This study aims to further elucidate the role of the mTOR pathway, in the development of medulloblastoma, and assess the use of mTOR inhibitors as novel therapeutic agents. Medulloblastoma cells treated with mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin, down-regulated pERK expression initially; however ERK activation was evident upon prolonged treatment. Phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrate, p70S6K at thr389 was reduced by rapamycin and pretreatment with rapamycin abrogated platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced activation of S6K, as well as that of mTORC2 substrate pAKT(Ser473). Activation of AKT was decreased at 1, 3, and 6 h of treatment, but extended treatment with rapamycin increased expression of pAKT(Ser473). Expression of cyclic dependent kinase inhibitor, P27, decreased following PDGF and increased following rapamycin treatment, suggesting their respective impact on cell proliferation via cell cycle control. Cell proliferation was increased by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment of medulloblastoma cells, while it was suppressed following treatment with rapamycin or U0126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor). pp242, a novel combined mTORC1/2 inhibitor, and rapamycin limited proliferation by reducing the S-Phase entry as assessed by EdU incorporation, while PDGF increased EdU incorporation. pp242 reduced the number of cells entering the S-phase to a greater extent than did rapamycin. Migration of medulloblastoma cells towards fibronectin was suppressed in a time-dependent manner after rapamycin treatment. These results indicate that the mTOR pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma, and that targeting this pathway may provide a strategy for therapy of medulloblastoma.",Avinash L AL;Marissa D MD;D Ryan DR;Michael M;Raj R;Meena M
22843869,"Targeting PI3KC2β impairs proliferation and survival in acute leukemia, brain tumours and neuroendocrine tumours.","Eight human catalytic phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) isoforms exist which are subdivided into three classes. While class I isoforms have been well-studied in cancer, little is known about the functions of class II PI3Ks. The expression pattern and functions of the class II PI3KC2β isoform were investigated in a panel of tumour samples and cell lines. Overexpression of PI3KC2β was found in subsets of tumours and cell lines from acute myeloid leukemia (AML), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), medulloblastoma (MB), neuroblastoma (NB), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Specific pharmacological inhibitors of PI3KC2β or RNA interference impaired proliferation of a panel of human cancer cell lines and primary cultures. Inhibition of PI3KC2β also induced apoptosis and sensitised the cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Together, these data show that PI3KC2β contributes to proliferation and survival in AML, brain tumours and neuroendocrine tumours, and may represent a novel target in these malignancies.",Danielle D;Kathrin T KT;Angela A;Ana S AS;Marin M;Tarek T;Paul P;Anthony A;Nahid N;Masahiko M;Hiroyuki H;Tomonobu T;Takahide T;Sarah S;Olivier O;Anelia A;Katrin K;Michael A MA;Karl K;Olivier O;Michael D MD;Alexandre A
22837778,Metachronous occurrence of nonradiation-induced brain cavernous hemangioma and medulloblastoma in a child with neurofibromatosis type I phenotype.,"Cavernous hemangioma (CH) is a sporadic vascular malformation occurring either as an autosomal dominant condition or as a well-known complication of radiation exposure. Medulloblastoma is a primitive neuroectodermal tumor common in children and currently treated with surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Neurofibromatosis is the most common single-gene disorder of the central nervous system. Posterior fossa malignant tumors in the context of neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) are very infrequent. This is the first documented case of an unusual metachronous occurrence of non-radiation-induced CH and medulloblastoma in a child with NF1 phenotype. We report the case of a 13-month-old boy with café-au-lait skin lesions associated with NF1-like phenotype who underwent surgical resection of a single CH in the temporal lobe due to recurrent seizures. Four years later he presented with signs of raised intracranial pressure associated with a posterior fossa tumor and hydrocephalus, thus requiring gross total resection of the lesion. Histological analysis revealed a medulloblastoma. After being treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, he achieved total remission. Six years later a massive recurrence of the tumor was observed and the child eventually died. The interest in this case lies in the rarity of NF1-like phenotype associated with a non-radiation-induced brain CH and medulloblastoma in a child.",Luciano L LL;Marcelo V MV;Elvis T ET;María S MS;Ricardo S RS
22832583,Dissecting the genomic complexity underlying medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma is an aggressively growing tumour, arising in the cerebellum or medulla/brain stem. It is the most common malignant brain tumour in children, and shows tremendous biological and clinical heterogeneity. Despite recent treatment advances, approximately 40% of children experience tumour recurrence, and 30% will die from their disease. Those who survive often have a significantly reduced quality of life. Four tumour subgroups with distinct clinical, biological and genetic profiles are currently identified. WNT tumours, showing activated wingless pathway signalling, carry a favourable prognosis under current treatment regimens. SHH tumours show hedgehog pathway activation, and have an intermediate prognosis. Group 3 and 4 tumours are molecularly less well characterized, and also present the greatest clinical challenges. The full repertoire of genetic events driving this distinction, however, remains unclear. Here we describe an integrative deep-sequencing analysis of 125 tumour-normal pairs, conducted as part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) PedBrain Tumor Project. Tetraploidy was identified as a frequent early event in Group 3 and 4 tumours, and a positive correlation between patient age and mutation rate was observed. Several recurrent mutations were identified, both in known medulloblastoma-related genes (CTNNB1, PTCH1, MLL2, SMARCA4) and in genes not previously linked to this tumour (DDX3X, CTDNEP1, KDM6A, TBR1), often in subgroup-specific patterns. RNA sequencing confirmed these alterations, and revealed the expression of what are, to our knowledge, the first medulloblastoma fusion genes identified. Chromatin modifiers were frequently altered across all subgroups. These findings enhance our understanding of the genomic complexity and heterogeneity underlying medulloblastoma, and provide several potential targets for new therapeutics, especially for Group 3 and 4 patients.",David T W DT;Natalie N;Marcel M;Thomas T;Barbara B;Marc M;Yoon-Jae YJ;Trevor J TJ;Volker V;Adrian M AM;Tobias T;Hans-Jörg HJ;Marina M;Sebastian S;Dominik D;Sabrina S;Huriye H;Elke E;Laura L;Andrea A;Marc M;Hendrik H;Sonja S;Theophilos T;Joachim J;Benjamin B;Meryem M;Vyacheslav V;Marc M;Ursula D UD;Qi Q;Bärbel B;Cynthia C CC;Manfred M;Christof C;Volker V;Chris C;Jürgen J;Rolf R;Vladimir V;Peter P;Jan J;Richard R;David D;Matthew J MJ;Robert B RB;Simona S;Gian Paolo GP;Ulrich U;Volkmar V;Norbert N;Yoo-Jin YJ;Camelia C;Wolfgang W;Andreas A;Christel C;Till T;Andreas E AE;Andreas A;Olaf O;Eberhard E;Jochen J;Martin M;Martin U MU;Michael C MC;Martin M;Nada N;Stefan S;André O AO;Dan D;Steven C SC;Martin G MG;V Peter VP;Stephan S;Stefan S;Hans H;Benedikt B;Wolfram W;Jörg J;Guido G;Paul A PA;Michael D MD;Matthew M;Scott L SL;Marie-Laure ML;Jan O JO;Andrey A;Roland R;Stefan M SM;Peter P
22832581,"Subgroup-specific structural variation across 1,000 medulloblastoma genomes.","Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour, is currently treated with nonspecific cytotoxic therapies including surgery, whole-brain radiation, and aggressive chemotherapy. As medulloblastoma exhibits marked intertumoural heterogeneity, with at least four distinct molecular variants, previous attempts to identify targets for therapy have been underpowered because of small samples sizes. Here we report somatic copy number aberrations (SCNAs) in 1,087 unique medulloblastomas. SCNAs are common in medulloblastoma, and are predominantly subgroup-enriched. The most common region of focal copy number gain is a tandem duplication of SNCAIP, a gene associated with Parkinson's disease, which is exquisitely restricted to Group 4α. Recurrent translocations of PVT1, including PVT1-MYC and PVT1-NDRG1, that arise through chromothripsis are restricted to Group 3. Numerous targetable SCNAs, including recurrent events targeting TGF-β signalling in Group 3, and NF-κB signalling in Group 4, suggest future avenues for rational, targeted therapy.",Paul A PA;David J H DJ;John J;Livia L;A Sorana AS;Thomas T;Adrian M AM;Andrey A;Jüri J;Steven E SE;Rameen R;David W DW;Christian R CR;Anath C AC;Stephen S;Adrian A;Yuan Y;Vijay V;Betty B;Adi A;Florence M G FM;Xin X;Marc M;Xiaochong X;Readman Y B RY;Andy A;Eric E;Richard D RD;Gemma R GR;Shaun D SD;Yisu Y;Allan A;Karen L KL;Ka Ming KM;Jenny Q JQ;Anthony G J AG;Nina T NT;Richard J RJ;Inanc I;Richard A RA;Andrew J AJ;Robert R;Daisuke D;Martine F MF;Marcel M;David T W DT;Hendrick H;Africa A;Anna M AM;Robert J RJ;Peter P;Tzvi T;Wieslawa A WA;Marta M;Christine C CC;Olivier O;Stéphanie S SS;François F FF;Sarah S SS;Byung-Kyu BK;Seung-Ki SK;Kyu-Chang KC;Wolfram W;Charles G CG;Michelle M;Anne A;Ian F IF;Xing X;Karin M KM;G Yancey GY;Concezio C;Luca L;Erna M C EM;Nanne K NK;Pim J PJ;Johan M JM;James M JM;Richard G RG;Karel K;Leos L;Reid C RC;Michael K MK;Boleslaw B;Roger E RE;Darell D DD;Adam A;Steffen S;Nada N;Janet C JC;Simon S;Nalin N;William A WA;László L;Almos A;Timothy E TE;Toshihiro T;Teiji T;Samer K SK;Jeffrey R JR;Joshua B JB;Linda M LM;Erwin G EG;Maryam M;Hideo H;Giuseppe G;Miklós M;Peter P;Ali G AG;Achille A;Shin S;Carlos G CG;Rajeev R;Young Shin YS;Shenandoah S;Massimo M;Claudia C CC;Jennifer A JA;Michael L ML;Poul H B PH;Matthew M;Scott L SL;Yoon-Jae YJ;Gary D GD;Uri U;Cynthia E CE;Eric E;Stephen W SW;James T JT;David D;Steven C SC;Steven J M SJ;Jan O JO;Stefan M SM;Marco A MA;Michael D MD
22829011,Two cases of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome associated with meningioma caused by a PTCH1 or SUFU germline mutation.,"Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by developmental defects and tumorigenesis. The gene responsible for NBCCS is PTCH1. The development of meningioma in NBCCS patients is a rare event. Here, we report two cases of NBCCS in which meningiomas did develop. The first patient carried a germline mutation in one allele of PTCH1, c.290dupA (p.N97KfsX43). In addition, the meningioma sample carried a somatic mutation, c.307delG (p.Val103LeufsX15), in the other allele of the same gene, suggesting a second hit. This is the first case of NBCCS-associated meningioma explained by the standard two-hit hypothesis. The second patient had a germline nonsense mutation in the SUFU gene, c.550C>T (p.Q184X). SUFU is located downstream of PTCH1 in the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway. This is the second time a germline mutation in SUFU has been found to cause NBCCS. Together with the previous report describing three cases of non-NBCCS medulloblastoma carrying a germline mutation in this gene, individuals with a SUFU germline mutation are expected to have a markedly high risk of developing medulloblastoma and probably meningioma.",Chihiro C;Toshiyuki T;Maiko M;Hidehiro H;Kiyotaka K
22828073,Comparison of therapeutic dosimetric data from passively scattered proton and photon craniospinal irradiations for medulloblastoma.,"For many decades, the standard of care radiotherapy regimen for medulloblastoma has been photon (megavoltage x-rays) craniospinal irradiation (CSI). The late effects associated with CSI are well-documented in the literature and are in-part attributed to unwanted dose to healthy tissue. Recently, there is growing interest in using proton therapy for CSI in pediatric and adolescent patients to reduce this undesirable dose. Previous comparisons of dose to target and non-target organs from conventional photon CSI and passively scattered proton CSI have been limited to small populations (n ≤ 3) and have not considered the use of age-dependent target volumes in proton CSI. Standard of care treatment plans were developed for both photon and proton CSI for 18 patients. This cohort included both male and female medulloblastoma patients whose ages, heights, and weights spanned a clinically relevant and representative spectrum (age 2-16, BMI 16.4-37.9 kg/m2). Differences in plans were evaluated using Wilcoxon signed rank tests for various dosimetric parameters for the target volumes and normal tissue. Proton CSI improved normal tissue sparing while also providing more homogeneous target coverage than photon CSI for patients across a wide age and BMI spectrum. Of the 24 parameters (V5, V10, V15, and V20 in the esophagus, heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys, and lungs) Wilcoxon signed rank test results indicated 20 were significantly higher for photon CSI compared to proton CSI (p ≤ 0.05) . Specifically, V15 and V20 in all six organs and V5, V10 in the esophagus, heart, liver, and thyroid were significantly higher with photon CSI. Our patient cohort is the largest, to date, in which CSI with proton and photon therapies have been compared. This work adds to the body of literature that proton CSI reduces dose to normal tissue compared to photon CSI for pediatric patients who are at substantial risk for developing radiogenic late effects. Although the present study focused on medulloblastoma, our findings are generally applicable to other tumors that are treated with CSI.",Rebecca M RM;Annelise A;Wendi W;Anita A;Carol J CJ;Anthony M AM;Kenneth L KL;Wayne D WD
22826514,Childhood medulloblastoma: the paradigm shift in molecular stratification and treatment profile.,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood, accounting for nearly 25% to 30% of primary central nervous system tumors in children younger than 18 years of age. Risk stratification into low and high risk categories has been based on age of clinical presentation, extent of postsurgical residual tumor, and disease dissemination. The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2007 recognized 5 histological subtypes as classic, anaplastic, large cell, desmoplastic/nodular, and medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity. Recent work with gene expression profiling along with histological classification has generated a novel combined histopathological and molecular stratification scheme into 4 subgroups (Wnt, Shh, group 3, and group 4). This could now help to identify patients who might benefit from dose escalation and de-escalation of therapy. Restratification brings optimism in treating these patients as scholars now have the ability to profile a more targeted therapy approach. This review discusses the literature regarding this new research endeavor.",Zsila Z;Tribhawan T;Soumen S
22821924,Imaging changes in very young children with brain tumors treated with proton therapy and chemotherapy.,"PT promises to reduce side effects in children with brain tumors by sparing normal tissue compared with 3D conformal or intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Information is lacking about the combined effects of PT and chemotherapy in young children. We describe imaging changes in 8 very young children with localized brain tumors who received PT after chemotherapy. Mostly transient signal abnormalities and enhancement in brain parenchyma were observed by serial MR imaging, which were consistent with radiation-induced effects on normal-appearing tissue. Correlation with PT planning data revealed that the areas of imaging abnormality were located within or adjacent to the volume that received the highest radiation dose. Radiologists should be aware of these findings in children who receive PT after chemotherapy. In this report, we describe the time course of these PT-related imaging findings and correlate them with treatment and clinical outcomes.",N D ND;T E TE;J H JH;Z Z;P P;I I;G T GT;K K;J J;D J DJ;A A
22820256,Medulloblastoma exome sequencing uncovers subtype-specific somatic mutations.,"Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumours in children. Identifying and understanding the genetic events that drive these tumours is critical for the development of more effective diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies. Recently, our group and others described distinct molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma on the basis of transcriptional and copy number profiles. Here we use whole-exome hybrid capture and deep sequencing to identify somatic mutations across the coding regions of 92 primary medulloblastoma/normal pairs. Overall, medulloblastomas have low mutation rates consistent with other paediatric tumours, with a median of 0.35 non-silent mutations per megabase. We identified twelve genes mutated at statistically significant frequencies, including previously known mutated genes in medulloblastoma such as CTNNB1, PTCH1, MLL2, SMARCA4 and TP53. Recurrent somatic mutations were newly identified in an RNA helicase gene, DDX3X, often concurrent with CTNNB1 mutations, and in the nuclear co-repressor (N-CoR) complex genes GPS2, BCOR and LDB1. We show that mutant DDX3X potentiates transactivation of a TCF promoter and enhances cell viability in combination with mutant, but not wild-type, β-catenin. Together, our study reveals the alteration of WNT, hedgehog, histone methyltransferase and now N-CoR pathways across medulloblastomas and within specific subtypes of this disease, and nominates the RNA helicase DDX3X as a component of pathogenic β-catenin signalling in medulloblastoma.",Trevor J TJ;Shyamal Dilhan SD;Tenley C TC;Daniel A DA;Daniel D;James J;Mauricio O MO;Scott L SL;Kristian K;Rachel L RL;Heidi H;Michael S MS;Niall J NJ;Aaron A;James J;Alex H AH;Michael G MG;Carsten C;Erica E;Andrey A;Brian B;Petar P;Pablo P;Jill P JP;Vladimir V;Natalia N;Soma S;Jessica Pierre JP;Paul A PA;Michael D MD;Furong F;Gerald R GR;Amanda G AG;Stacey B SB;Gad G;Natalie N;David T W DT;Peter P;Stefan M SM;Thomas M TM;Matthew M;Scott L SL;Yoon-Jae YJ
22819012,Malignant dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour in a zebrafish (Danio rerio).,"Neuroectodermal tumours in man, including medulloblastoma, medulloepithelioma, neuroblastoma, esthesioneuroblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumour and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour, typically occur in children and young adults. These tumour types are occasionally observed in juvenile and adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) either as induced tumours in carcinogen-exposed zebrafish or as an incidental finding in zebrafish≥2years of age. An adult zebrafish submitted for routine histological examination was sent for a second opinion consultation after an uncharacteristic brain mass was identified. Microscopically, the expansile and infiltrative extracortical mass arising from the cerebellum had a diffuse microcystic pattern with solid hypercellular regions occupying 80% of the extrameningeal space and effacing the endomeninx and significantly displacing the metencephalon. The mass was composed of dense sheets of oligodendrocyte-like cells, random neurons and pseudocysts containing 'floating neurons' within a scant mucinous matrix. Neoplastic cells demonstrated positive perinuclear and intracytoplasmic expression of S-100. Malignant dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour was diagnosed based on the histological features of the brain mass, which were indistinguishable from the human tumour. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour in a zebrafish.",T S TS;J R JR;K N KN;J L JL;W I WI;M L ML
22816225,Cathepsin D and its prognostic value in neuroepithelial brain tumors.,"Expression of Cathepsin D (Cath D) in some primary neuroepithelial brain tumors and its prognostic value were studied. The research included 65 samples of human primary neuroepithelial brain tumors. There were 50 glial tumors (10 diffuse astrocytomas (DA), 15 anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), 25 glioblastomas (GB), 15 embryonic tumors (15 medulloblastomas (MB) as well as 5 samples of normal brain tissue. Immunohistochemical method was applied to monitor diffuse positive reaction in the cytoplasm of brain tumor cells, endothelial cells and tumor stromal cells and showed diffuse positive reaction for Cath D in the cytoplasm of brain tumor cells, endothelial cells and stromal cells in all analyzed samples of DA, AA, GB and MB as well as in microglial cells, neurons and in endothelial cells in all analyzed samples of normal brain tissue. Qualitative analysis of Cath D expression in the cytoplasm of brain tumor cells and endothelial cells as well as the percentage of brain tumor cells, endothelial cells and stromal cells immunopositive for Cath D showed that there was difference between analyzed brain tumor groups, but according to statistical tests the difference was not statistically significant. Survival correlated with the percentage of stromal cells immunopositive for Cath D. Survival prognosis was influenced by the percentage of stromal cells immunopositive for Cath D and tumor grade. The obtained results singled out the percentage of stromal cells immunopositive for Cath D as an independent parameter. The results of this research on the prognostic value of Cath D in some primary brain tumors of neuroepithelial origin indicate that there is real possibility to use Cath D as an independent prognostic factor in human glioma progression and thus open up possibilities for further scientific research.",Biserka B;Branko B;Svjetlana S;Silvija S
22815056,Mutations in Lyar and p53 are synergistically lethal in female mice.,"Ly-1 antibody reactive clone (LYAR) is a nucleolar zinc finger protein that has been implicated in cell growth, self-renewal of embryonic stem cells, and medulloblastoma. To test whether LYAR is critical for cell growth and development, we generated Lyar mutant mice. Mice carrying the mutant Lyar(gt) allele were generated from embryonic stem cells that contained a gene-trap insertion in the Lyar gene. Phenotypic analyses were performed on Lyar mutant mice and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Lyar(gt/gt) mice were crossed to mice lacking the p53 tumor suppressor protein and Lyar/p53 compound mutants scored for external abnormalities. Lyar(gt/gt) homozygotes are viable, fertile, and indistinguishable from wild type littermates. However, the growth of Lyar(+/gt) and Lyar(gt/gt) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) was impaired, coincident with an increase in the steady-state level of p53 and a key p53 effector of growth arrest, p21, suggesting that a cellular stress response is triggered in the absence of a wild type level of LYAR. Remarkably, the majority of Lyar(+/gt) and Lyar(gt/gt) female mice lacking p53 mice failed to survive. The neural tube defect (NTD) exencephaly was observed in ≈26% and ≈61% of female Lyar(+/gt;) p53(-/-) and Lyar(gt/gt;) p53(-/-) embryos, respectively. Lyar/p53 mutant mice represent a new digenic model of NTDs. Furthermore, these studies identify Lyar as a novel candidate gene for a role in human NTDs. These results provide new data to support the idea that loss of a p53-mediated developmental checkpoint may increase the risk of NTDs owing to some germline mutations.",Guan G;Christopher M CM;Reem R;Sara S;Paul W PW;Susan M SM
22814953,Differential proliferative index of cancer stem-like cells in primary and recurrent medulloblastoma in human.,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant primitive neuroectodermal tumor found in children. It has a tendency to recur at a primary or distant site. The mechanism underlying the regulation of the recurrence of medulloblastoma remains largely unknown. Recently, several reports have described that cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) can be identified and isolated in medulloblastoma. The authors therefore attempted to demonstrate the correlation between the biological features of medulloblastoma's CSCs and its recurrence. The data used were obtained in five consecutive patients with medulloblastomas who subsequently experienced tumor recurrence from 2004 to 2007. The authors performed the immunohistochemical assays to analyze the expression of CSC markers, proliferation features, and proliferative status of CSCs in primary and recurrent medulloblastoma. Of the five patients, two had recurrence at the primary site and three had a distant recurrence. CSC markers such as CD133(Prominin-1), DCX, PSA-NCAM, TUC-4, and nestin were expressed regardless of primary or recurrent medulloblastoma. All the five tumor specimens had a high proliferation index (PI). The PI was even higher in the group of patients after recurrence at a distant site (p<0.05), while the PI remained almost the same after primary recurrence. The Ki67/nestin-, Ki67/DCX-, and Ki67/TUC-4-positive cells were significantly increased in recurrent medulloblastoma at both the primary and distant sites, whereas CSCs in primary medulloblastoma showed much lower proliferative features (p<0.05). Our data suggest that tumorigenesis of medulloblastomas and their recurrence might be related to CSCs. More proliferating CSCs in medulloblastomas denote worse prognosis.",Xuqun X;Yu Y;Jingjing J;Kunlin K;Yin Y;Ying Y;Liangfu L
22811513,Population survival from childhood cancer in Britain during 1978-2005 by eras of entry to clinical trials.,"Inclusion in clinical trials is generally viewed as best practice for most newly diagnosed childhood cancers, but the impact on population-based survival has rarely been examined. The population-based data were analysed for 25 853 children (66% of all registered childhood cancers) diagnosed in Britain during 1978-2005 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms tumour, hepatoblastoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and germ-cell tumours. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared by log-rank tests. Time trends were analysed by Cox regression. Separate analyses were done for children with ALL, medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma according to clinically relevant age thresholds. Survival increased significantly during 1978-2005 for every diagnostic category; the annual reduction in risk of death ranged from 2.7% (rhabdomyosarcoma) to 12.0% (gonadal germ-cell tumours). Survival increased steadily between trial eras for ALL (age 1-14 years) and neuroblastoma (age 1-14 years), but changed little since the mid-1980s for medulloblastoma (age 0-2 years), osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma. Changes in survival between trial eras parallel those reported by the relevant clinical trials. The increasing level of participation in trials, facilitated by the organisation of specialist care, has underpinned the substantial improvements in survival seen at the population level.",C A CA;M E ME;K K
22810114,Identification of ALK germline mutation (3605delG) in pediatric anaplastic medulloblastoma.,"The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene has been found either rearranged or mutated in several neoplasms such as anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and anaplastic thyroid cancer. Medulloblastoma (MB) is an embryonic pediatric cancer arising from nervous system, a tissue in which ALK is expressed during embryonic development. We performed an ALK mutation screening in 52 MBs and we found a novel heterozygous germline deletion of a single base in exon 23 (3605delG) in a case with marked anaplasia. This G deletion results in a frameshift mutation producing a premature stop codon in exon 25 of ALK tyrosine kinase domain. We also screened three human MB cell lines without finding any mutation of ALK gene. Quantitative expression analysis of 16 out of 52 samples showed overexpression of ALK mRNA in three MBs. In the present study, we report the first mutation of ALK found in MB. Moreover, a deletion of ALK gene producing a stop codon has not been detected in human tumors up to now. Further investigations are now required to elucidate whether the truncated form of ALK may have a role in signal transduction.",Simona S;Marilena M;Francesca F;Tiziana T;Vita V;Immacolata I;André A;Gian Paolo GP;Luca L
22808009,Role of MXD3 in proliferation of DAOY human medulloblastoma cells.,"A subset of medulloblastomas, the most common brain tumor in children, is hypothesized to originate from granule neuron precursors (GNPs) in which the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway is over-activated. MXD3, a basic helix-look-helix zipper transcription factor of the MAD family, has been reported to be upregulated during postnatal cerebellar development and to promote GNP proliferation and MYCN expression. Mxd3 is upregulated in mouse models of medulloblastoma as well as in human medulloblastomas. Therefore, we hypothesize that MXD3 plays a role in the cellular events that lead to medulloblastoma biogenesis. In agreement with its proliferative role in GNPs, MXD3 knock-down in DAOY cells resulted in decreased proliferation. Sustained overexpression of MXD3 resulted in decreased cell numbers due to increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Structure-function analysis revealed that the Sin3 interacting domain, the basic domain, and binding to E-boxes are essential for this activity. Microarray-based expression analysis indicated up-regulation of 84 genes and down-regulation of 47 genes. Potential direct MXD3 target genes were identified by ChIP-chip. Our results suggest that MXD3 is necessary for DAOY medulloblastoma cell proliferation. However, increased level and/or duration of MXD3 expression ultimately reduces cell numbers via increased cell death and cell cycle arrest.",Gustavo A GA;Tin T;Martin M;Daniel D;Mehdi H MH;Tuong-Vi TV;Daniel D;Wanna W;Elva E
22800515,[Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors of central nervous system in childhood: a clinical and histopathologic study of 6 cases].,"To study the clinicopathologic features, immunohistochemical findings, diagnosis and differential diagnosis of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) of central nervous system in childhood. The clinicopathologic data, morphologic features and immunophenotypes were reviewed in 6 cases of AT/RT. EnVision method was applied. Antibodies include cytokeratin (CK), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), vimentin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), muscle specific actin (MSA), glial fibrinary acid protein (GFAP), desmin, placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) and INI1. Five of the six cases of AT/RT occurred in infancy and early childhood. Histologically, the predominant component was rhabdoid cells. Cytoplasmic inclusions were present in all cases. Primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) component was also identified in 5 of the 6 cases studied. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen and vimentin. The staining for INI1, desmin and PLAP was negative. Smooth muscle actin was expressed in 2 cases and glial fibrillary acidic protein in 5 cases. The proliferative index as demonstrated by Ki-67 staining was high. AT/RT is not a particularly uncommon malignancy in childhood. The histologic hallmark is the presence of rhabdoid cells with cytoplasmic inclusions. The tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen and vimentin, and negative for INI1. Differential diagnosis includes PNET, medulloblastoma and medullomyoblastoma.",Ying-juan YJ;Zhong-de ZD;Min-zhi MZ;Xiang-ru XR
22798206,Mechanism for the induction of cell death in ONS-76 medulloblastoma cells by Zhangfei/CREB-ZF.,"Cells from medulloblastoma lines do not contain detectable amounts of the basic leucine-zipper protein Zhangfei. However, we have previously shown that expression of this protein in cells of the ONS-76 and UW228 medulloblastoma lines causes the cells to stop growing and develop processes that resemble neurites. Our objective was to determine the molecular mechanisms by which Zhangfei influences ONS-76 cells. We infected ONS-76 cells with adenovirus vectors expressing either Zhangfei or the control protein LacZ and then compared the following parameters in Zhangfei and LacZ-expressing cells: (a) markers of apoptosis, autophagy and macropinocytosis, (b) transcripts for genes involved in neurogenesis and apoptosis, (c) phosphorylation of peptide targets of selected cellular protein kinases, and (d) activation of transcription factors. Zhangfei-expressing cells appeared to succumb to apoptosis. Increased staining for autophagic vesicles and upregulated expression of autophagy response genes in these cells indicated that they were undergoing autophagy, possibly associated with apoptosis. Within our analysis, patterns of gene expression and phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction activity in Zhangfei-expressing cells indicated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway was active. In addition, we found that the transcription factor Brn3a as well as factors implicated in differentiation were also active in Zhangfei-expressing cells. We tested the hypothesis that Zhangfei enhances the expression of Brn3a, a known inducer of TrkA, the high-affinity receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF). TrkA then engages NGF in an autocrine manner triggering the MAPK pathway and leading to differentiation of ONS-76 cells into neuron and glia-like cells-a process that eventually brings about cell death. We showed that: (a) Zhangfei could enhance transcription from the isolated Brn3a promoter, (b) ONS-76 cells produced NGF and (c) antibodies against NGF and inhibitors of TrkA and selected components of the MAPK pathway could partially restore the growth of Zhangfei-expressing ONS-76 cells.",Timothy W TW;Scott S;Noreen N;Vikram V
22796365,Medulloblastoma stem cells: modeling tumor heterogeneity.,"Brain tumors represent the leading cause of childhood cancer mortality, with medulloblastoma (MB) being the most frequent malignant tumor. In this review we discuss the morphological and molecular heterogeneity of this malignant childhood brain tumor and how this key feature has implicated the presence of a MB stem cell. We focus on evidence from cerebellar development, histopathological and molecular subtypes of MB, the recent identification of brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs, also referred to as MB stem cells), and the current limitations in studying the interplay between MB stem cells and tumor heterogeneity.",Branavan B;Chitra C;Nicole N;Bradley W BW;Sandra E SE;Katrin K;Sheila K SK
22796286,[Genetic predisposition to childhood cancer].,"Tumor predisposition in children is rare, accounting for approximately 10% of all cancers in childhood. Tumor predisposition involves very rare tumors such as pleuropulmonary blastoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, hepatoblastoma, rhabdoid tumors, optic pathway glioma, as well as rare tumors such as retinoblastoma, medulloblastoma, nephroblastoma, or more frequent tumors such as sarcomas, neuroblastoma, and leukemias. The identification of these predispositions is important for improved management for both the child and relatives. Prenatal and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are options that could be considered for young parents in a perspective of future pregnancies. This manuscript describes the main tumor predispositions in childhood. From each histological subtype, the different diagnosis directions are discussed in view of these main tumor predispositions.",C C;M M;N N;I I

22790857,Immunohistochemical expression of CRX in extracranial malignant small round cell tumors.,"Tumor-specific immunohistochemical markers are valuable in the differential diagnosis of malignant small round cell tumors (MSRCTs). The cone-rod homeobox-containing gene (CRX) is a transcription factor that is preferentially expressed in retinal photoreceptor cells. It has been shown that the CRX antibody is a good immunohistochemical marker to differentiate retinoblastoma from other intracranial MSRCTs. Outside of the central nervous system, however, the usefulness of CRX immunohistochemistry in establishing a diagnosis of metastatic retinoblastoma is uncertain, as the expression of CRX in primitive neuroectodermal tumor/Ewing sarcoma (PNET/ES), neuroblastoma, and other MSRCTs is unknown. Archival specimens from resections, core biopsies, and bone marrow biopsies of 41 neuroblastomas, 24 PNET/ES, 19 embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, 17 alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, 17 Wilms tumors, 14 desmoplastic small round cell tumors, 20 medulloblastomas, 9 pineal tumors, 17 melanocytic tumors (compound and Spitz nevi), and 8 retinoblastomas were immunostained for CRX. All retinoblastomas had strong diffuse nuclear immunoreactivity for CRX; 8 of the 20 medulloblastomas showed strong nuclear immunoreactivity either in occasional clusters of tumor cells or in rare single scattered tumor cells; 3 of the 9 pineal tumors showed strong nuclear immunoreactivity in approximately 40% to 50% of the tumor cells. Neuroblastomas, PNET/ES, embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, Wilms tumors, desmoplastic small round cell tumors, and melanocytic tumors were all negative. Scant nonspecific cytoplasmic staining was observed in some tumors, mostly PNET/ES. These findings suggest that CRX is a useful marker to discriminate metastatic retinoblastoma from other, more common, MSRCTs of childhood.",Jefferson J;Monica L ML;Carlos C;Antonio R AR
22790443,Pilot study of systemic and intrathecal mafosfamide followed by conformal radiation for infants with intracranial central nervous system tumors: a pediatric brain tumor consortium study (PBTC-001).,"A pilot study to investigate the feasibility of the addition of intrathecal (IT) mafosfamide to a regimen of concomitant multi-agent systemic chemotherapy followed by conformal radiation therapy (RT) for children <3 years with newly diagnosed embryonal CNS tumors was performed. Ninety-three newly diagnosed infants and children (<3 years) with embryonal CNS tumors were enrolled. Twenty weeks of systemic multi-agent chemotherapy commenced within 35 days of surgery. Patients without CSF flow obstruction (n = 71) received IT mafosfamide (14 mg) with chemotherapy. Localized (M(0)) patients with SD or better subsequently received RT followed by 20 additional weeks of chemotherapy. Second look surgery was encouraged prior to RT if there was an incomplete surgical resection at diagnosis. 71 evaluable patients with normal CSF flow received IT Mafosfamide with systemic chemotherapy; patients with M + disease were removed from protocol therapy at 20 weeks and those with PD at the time of progression. One and 5-year progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the cohort of 71 evaluable patients were 52 ± 6.5 % and 33 ± 13 %, and 67 ± 6.2 % and 51 ± 11 %, respectively. The 1-year Progression Free Survival (PFS) for M0 patients with medulloblastoma (MB, n = 20), supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET, n = 9), and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT, n = 12) was 80 ± 7 %, 67 ± 15 % and 27 ± 13 % and 5-year PFS was 65 ± 19 %, 37 ± 29 %, and 0 ± 0 %, respectively. The addition of IT mafosfamide to systemic chemotherapy in infants with embryonal CNS tumors was feasible. The PFS for M0 patients appears comparable to or better than most prior historical comparisons and was excellent for those receiving conformal radiotherapy.",Susan M SM;Mehmet M;Amar A;Murali M;Thomas T;Mark M;Ian F IF;Sri S;Russ R;Peter P;Roger E RE;Roger R;Stewart S;Anu A;Richard R;James M JM;Larry L
22785044,Enhancing psychosocial outcomes for young adult childhood CNS cancer survivors: importance of addressing vocational identity and community integration.,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between vocational identity, community integration, positive and negative affect, and satisfaction with life in a group of young adult central nervous system (CNS) cancer survivors. Participants in this study included 45 young adult CNS cancer survivors who ranged in age from 18 to 30 years (mean=22, SD=3.62), with a mean age at diagnosis of 8.8 years. Four standardized instruments were used to assess the individual's affect, satisfaction with life, vocational identity, and self-perceived level of community integration. Pearson correlation analyses were carried out to examine the relationships between the satisfaction with life and positive and negative affect, vocational identify, and community integration. A hierarchical linear regression was then performed to determine how well these variables predict satisfaction with life among CNS cancer survivors. Significant positive correlations were found between life satisfaction and positive affect (r=0.423, P<0.01), as well as life satisfaction and community integration (r=-505, P<0.001). A positive correlation between life satisfaction and vocational identity was only marginally significant (r=0.312, P<0.05). Regression results indicate that the model explained 29% of the variance with community integration making a unique contribution. The largest contribution of this study is that the findings provide initial evidence that addressing vocational identity and community integration may be important constructs in improving young adult CNS survivors' overall levels of satisfaction with life. These constructs have not been typically addressed in psychosocial cancer treatment programs.",David R DR;Stacia S;Alex W K AW
22782892,STK25 protein mediates TrkA and CCM2 protein-dependent death in pediatric tumor cells of neural origin.,"The TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase induces death in medulloblastoma cells via an interaction with the cerebral cavernous malformation 2 (CCM2) protein. We used affinity proteomics to identify the germinal center kinase class III (GCKIII) kinases STK24 and STK25 as novel CCM2 interactors. Down-modulation of STK25, but not STK24, rescued medulloblastoma cells from NGF-induced TrkA-dependent cell death, suggesting that STK25 is part of the death-signaling pathway initiated by TrkA and CCM2. CCM2 can be phosphorylated by STK25, and the kinase activity of STK25 is required for death signaling. Finally, STK25 expression in tumors is correlated with positive prognosis in neuroblastoma patients. These findings delineate a death-signaling pathway downstream of neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinases that may provide targets for therapeutic intervention in pediatric tumors of neural origin.",Barbara B;Michelle J MJ;Volker V;James D R JD;Alice A;Zehava Z;Derek F DF;Beatriz Gonzalez BG;Roland R;Rainer R;Anne-Claude AC;Mike M
22773561,Review: In vivo models for defining molecular subtypes of the primitive neuroectodermal tumor genome: current challenges and solutions.,"Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) of the brain include medulloblastoma (MB) and central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor (CNS PNET) subtypes, which share histological features yet differ at the genomic level and in clinical outcome. Delineation of the genetic anomalies between PNET subtypes is a current challenge for establishing effective targeted therapeutic strategies against these aggressive tumors. Current efforts have demonstrated that specific molecular pathways drive a subset of MB and CNS PNET, but the genetic basis for the deadliest forms of these tumors remains poorly understood and anecdotal. This is in part due to an overall lack of biologically relevant in vivo and in vitro model systems capable of direct comparison and identification of the genetic origins among PNET subtypes. Forward genetic, random mutagenesis in mice is an effective phenotype-driven method to model the genetic origins of human disease including cancer. We have applied this method to PNET by developing a single Sleeping Beauty transposon insertional mutagenesis mouse model that recapitulates the morphological similarities and genetic heterogeneity of MB and CNS PNET capable of identifying genetic drivers important for genesis of PNET. Importantly, this model has allowed new PNET phenotypes to be observed and is designed to reveal biologically relevant candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes for MB and CNS PNET molecular subgroups in mice and humans. The ultimate goal of the approach we have taken is to uncover new understanding of the genetic basis for MB and CNS PNET development, how they are distinguished from each other, and offer potential targets for therapeutic testing to improve patient clinical outcome.",Jon D JD;David A DA
22770959,"Sonic Hedgehog in pancreatic cancer: from bench to bedside, then back to the bench.","Developmental genes are known to regulate cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation; thus, it comes as no surprise that the misregulation of developmental genes plays an important role in the biology of human cancers. One such pathway that has received an increasing amount of attention for its function in carcinogenesis is the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. Initially the domain of developmental biologists, the Hh pathway and one of its ligands, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), have been shown to play an important role in body planning and organ development, particularly in the foregut endoderm. Their importance in human disease became known to cancer biologists when germline mutations that resulted in the unregulated activity of the Hh pathway were found to cause basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma. Since then, misexpression of the Hh pathway has been shown to play an important role in many other cancers, including those of the pancreas. In many institutions, investigators are targeting misexpression of the Hh pathway in clinical trials, but there is still much fundamental knowledge to be gained about this pathway that can shape its clinical utility. This review will outline the evolution of our understanding of this pathway as it relates to the pancreas, as well as how the Hh pathway came to be a high-priority target for treatment.",David E DE;Andrew S AS;Oliver O;Stefan S;Dirk D;Nakul P NP;Janivette J;Birte B;Joo Kyung JK;Junpei J;Jennifer J;Sarah P SP
22768993,Necrosis after craniospinal irradiation: results from a prospective series of children with central nervous system embryonal tumors.,"Necrosis of the central nervous system (CNS) is a known complication of craniospinal irradiation (CSI) in children with medulloblastoma and similar tumors. We reviewed the incidence of necrosis in our prospective treatment series. Between 1996 and 2009, 236 children with medulloblastoma (n = 185) or other CNS embryonal tumors (n = 51) received postoperative CSI followed by dose-intense cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and cisplatin. Average risk cases (n = 148) received 23.4 Gy CSI, 36 Gy to the posterior fossa, and 55.8 Gy to the primary; after 2003, the treatment was 23.4 Gy CSI and 55.8 Gy to the primary. All high-risk cases (n = 88) received 36-39.6 Gy CSI and 55.8 Gy primary. The primary site clinical target volume margin was 2 cm (pre-2003) or 1 cm (post-2003). With competing risk of death by any cause, we determined the cumulative incidence of necrosis. With a median follow-up of 52 months (range, 4-163 months), eight cases of necrosis were documented. One death was attributed. The median time to the imaging evidence was 4.8 months and to symptoms 6.0 months. The cumulative incidence at 5 years was 3.7% ± 1.3% (n = 236) for the entire cohort and 4.4% ± 1.5% (n = 196) for infratentorial tumor location. The mean relative volume of infratentorial brain receiving high-dose irradiation was significantly greater for patients with necrosis than for those without: ≥ 50 Gy (92.12% ± 4.58% vs 72.89% ± 1.96%; P=.0337), ≥ 52 Gy (88.95% ± 5.50% vs 69.16% ± 1.97%; P=.0275), and ≥ 54 Gy (82.28% ± 7.06% vs 63.37% ± 1.96%; P=.0488), respectively. Necrosis in patients with CNS embryonal tumors is uncommon. When competing risks are considered, the incidence is 3.7% at 5 years. The volume of infratentorial brain receiving greater than 50, 52, and 54 Gy, respectively, is predictive for necrosis.",Erin S ES;Thomas E TE;Shengjie S;Xiaoping X;Renin R;Karen D KD;Ibrahim I;Gregory T GT;Alberto A;Amar A
22766741,Action of db-cAMP on the bystander effect and chemosensitivity through connexin 43 and Bcl-2-mediated pathways in medulloblastoma cells.,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is one of the most common malignant brain tumors of childhood and is associated with a poor prognosis. Gap-junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is an important mode for cell-to-cell communication. Dysfunctional GJIC is exhibited in most cancer cells. There is significant evidence that GJIC is important in at least some prodrug/suicide gene systems by augmenting the bystander effect (BE). GJIC is made up of connexins (Cxs), among which Cx43 is present in most tissues. Bcl-2, an important apoptosis blocker, is closely associated with the sensitivity to anticancer drugs. Our study showed that dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (db-cAMP) upregulated the Cx43 expression and GJIC function in Daoy medulloblastoma cells. It directly enhanced the BE using a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV‑tk)/ganciclovir (GCV) system, which was blocked by a Cx43 inhibitor. In addition, db-cAMP increased the cytotoxicity of temozolomide and teniposide, possibly by downregulating the Bcl-2 expression and inducing apoptosis. Taken together, we demonstrated the beneficial effect of db-cAMP in treating medulloblastoma depending on the upregulation of BE and chemosensitivity through Cx43 and Bcl-2-mediated pathways.",Peixin P;Yunhui Y;Haoqiang H;Shaoyi S
22763761,Immunohistochemical expression of cell-cycle regulators in pediatric embryonal brain tumors.,"Embryonal tumors constitute the most common malignant brain tumor group in children. Experimental results indicate that genes involved in cell cycle and signal transduction are deregulated in medulloblastoma (MB) and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT). The cell cycle is regulated by protein complexes composed of a regulatory subunit called Cyclin and a catalytic domain named Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). Cyclins and CDKs are in turn regulated by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKI) which inhibit cell-cycle progression. Cyclins D and Cyclin E are important for the passage of cells through G1 to S phase. P-27, a member of the universal CDKI family, is important in regulating the G1/S transition. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of p-27, Cyclin D3, and Cyclin E, and their possible prognostic significance in pediatric embryonal brain tumors. We retrospectively evaluated 51 children with embryonal tumors that were treated surgically in our institute. All patients had regular follow up examinations. The streptavidin-biotin HRP method was performed on paraffin sections for detection of p-27, Cyclin D3, and Cyclin E. There were 42 cases of MB and nine cases of AT/RT. Cyclin D3 expression was detected in 11/42 MB and 3/9 AT/RT patients. Cyclin E expression was detected in 28/42 MB and 8/9 AT/RT patients. High expression of Ki-67 (>50 %) and p-27 (>50 %) was observed in 23.8-73.8 % of MB patients. Combined high Ki-67 and p-27 expression was observed in 21.4 % cases of MB. In these cases there was expression of Cyclin E in 88.8 % and Cyclin D3 in 22.2 % of MB. No significant correlation was found between Ki-67 and p-27, Cyclin D3, and E. No correlation was found between Cyclin D3, Cyclin E, p-27, and overall survival. Increased p-27 and Cyclin E expression was detected in a substantial number of MB patients and in nearly all AT/RT patients. Further studies on a larger number of patients are needed to clarify a possible correlation of p-27 and Cyclin E with tumor behavior.",Maria M;George A GA;Amalia A;George G;George G;Neofytos N;Kalliopi K
22754205,"A study of histopathological spectrum and expression of Ki-67, TP53 in primary brain tumors of pediatric age group.","The primary brain tumors are the second most common cause of death due to malignancies in children. This study was done to analyze the histological spectrum of primary brain tumors in children and also to find out the expression of p53 and Ki67 in some of the common pediatric brain tumors. This study was done over a period of 2.5 years. The patients were followed up until 6 months to determine the outcome. We examined H and E sections from 61 pediatric brain tumors and also performed immunohistochemical stains with p53 and Ki67 on 52 of these samples. Of the 61 cases of pediatric brain tumors the commonest were pilocytic astrocytomas and medulloblastomas both constituting 22.9% of total cases, followed by high grade gliomas, that is, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma taken together (14.7%), diffuse astrocytomas (11.4%), ependymomas (8.1%), and oligodendrogliomas (4.9%). Other cases comprised craniopharyngiomas, astroblastomas, and gangliocytoma. The mean age of presentation was 9.3 years, male children being more commonly affected. Ki67 labeling index (LI) and p53 expression in pilocytic astrocytomas and diffuse astrocytomas were significantly lower than that of high-grade astrocytomas. However, there was no significant difference of expression of these two antigens in pilocytic astrocytomas and diffuse astrocytomas. It was found that Ki67 LI was a better marker for distinguishing between grades of astrocytoma than p53 (P=0.000 and P=0.002, respectively). The survival in cases of pilocytic astrocytomas was far better than high-grade gliomas. However, there was no significant difference in survival between pilocytic astrocytoma and diffuse infiltrating astrocytoma. There was significant positive correlation between expression of p53 and Ki67 LI in cases of medulloblastomas. Both p53 (P=0.002) and Ki67 LI (P=0.000) taken individually correlated well with survival in these cases. Also, Ki67 LI is better predictor of outcome than p53. From this study, it can be concluded that Ki67 and p53 score correlated well with the grade of astrocytoma; however, Ki67 is a better marker for differentiating between the grades of astrocytoma than p53. Also, Ki67 LI is a better prognostic factor than p53 in case of medulloblastomas.",Subhalakshmi S;Uttara U;Uma U;Samarendranath S;Sandip S;Ashit K AK
22753727,Effects of Zeng Sheng Ping/ACAPHA on malignant brain tumor growth and Notch signaling.,"Zeng Sheng Ping (ZSP) is a traditional herbal remedy used to prevent progression and growth of neoplastic lesions. It has been shown to inhibit Notch2 expression in a murine lung cancer model, leading us to investigate its therapeutic potential in Notch-dependent brain tumors. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS), apoptosis, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses were performed in glioma and medulloblastoma cell lines, and morphological analyses in DAOY flank xenografts. ZSP inhibited brain tumor growth in vitro, in part, by apoptotic induction. Down-regulation of the Notch2 receptor, the pathway target Hairy/Enhancer of Split homolog 1 (Hes1), and of the stem cell markers Nestin and CD133 was also observed. Reductions in tumor mass and increases in the necrotic fraction of DAOY xenografts, in mice treated with oral ZSP were also observed, but these were not significant. ZSP can block brain tumor growth and the expression of Notch pathway members and stem cell markers in vitro.",Kah Jing KJ;Kda K;Charles G CG
22753001,Initial testing of the MDM2 inhibitor RG7112 by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program.,"RG7112 is a selective inhibitor of p53-MDM2 binding that frees p53 from negative control, activating the p53 pathway in cancer cells leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. RG7112 was selected for evaluation by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) due to the relatively low incidence of p53 mutations in pediatric cancers compared with adult malignancies. RG7112 and its inactive enantiomer RG7112i were evaluated against the 23 cell lines of the PPTP in vitro panel using 96 hours exposure (1 nM to 10 µM). It was tested against the PPTP in vivo panel focusing on p53 wild-type (WT) xenografts at a dose of 100 mg/kg daily for 14 days followed by 4 weeks of observation. Response outcomes were related to MDM2 and p53 expression datasets (http://pptp.nchresearch.org/data.html). RG7112 demonstrated cytotoxic activity with a lower median IC(50) for p53 WT versus p53 mutant cell lines (approximately 0.4 µM vs. >10 µM, respectively). RG7112 induced tumor growth inhibition meeting criteria for intermediate activity (EFS T/C > 2) in 10 of 26 (38%) solid tumor xenografts. Objective responses included medulloblastoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms, rhabdoid and Ewing sarcoma xenografts. For the ALL panel, there was one partial response, five complete responses and one maintained complete response. The ALL xenografts expressed the highest levels of p53 among the PPTP panels. RG7112 induced tumor regressions in solid tumors from different histotype panels, and exhibited consistent high-level activity against ALL xenografts. This high level of activity supports prioritization of RG7112 for further evaluation.",Hernan H;C Patrick CP;Min H MH;Stephen T ST;John M JM;Richard R;E Anders EA;Catherine A CA;Brian B;Raushan T RT;Peter J PJ;Malcolm A MA;Richard B RB
22747092,Diffuse intrinsic pontine tumors: a study of primitive neuroectodermal tumors versus the more common diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas.,"The diagnosis of diffuse pontine tumors has largely been made on the basis of MRI since the early 1990 s. In cases of tumors considered ""typical,"" as a rule, no biopsy specimen has been obtained, and the tumors have been considered diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs). There have been sporadic reports that primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) of the pons may not be distinguishable from the DIPGs by radiological imaging. This study presents 2 cases of diffuse pontine PNETs with molecular evidence that these are indeed PNETs, distinct from DIPGs, thus supporting biopsy of diffuse pontine tumors as a standard of care. Biopsy specimens were obtained from 7 diffuse pontine tumors and snap frozen. Two of these 7 tumors were identified on the basis of pathological examination as PNETs. All 7 of the diffuse pontine tumors were analyzed for gene expression using the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip microarray. Gene expression was compared with that of supratentorial PNETs, medulloblastomas, and low- and high-grade gliomas outside the brainstem. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression demonstrated that pontine PNETs are most closely related to PNETs of the supratentorial region and not with gliomas. They do not cluster with the 5 DIPGs in the study. Thirty-eight genes, including GATA3, are uniquely differentially expressed in pontine PNETs compared with other types of pediatric brain tumors, including DIPGs and other PNETs at a false discovery rate statistical significance of less than 0.05. The cluster and individual gene expression analyses indicate that pontine PNETs are intrinsically different from DIPGs. The 2 pontine PNET cases cluster with supratentorial PNETs, rather than with DIPGs, suggesting that these tumors should be treated with a PNET regimen, not with DIPG therapy. Since diagnosis by imaging is not reliable and the biology of the tumors is disparate, a biopsy should be performed to enable accurate diagnosis and direct potentially more effective treatments.",Alexandra A;Andrew M AM;Diane K DK;Jeffrey A JA;Laura Z LZ;Paul P;Todd C TC;Michael H MH;Nicholas K NK
22747089,Primary cerebellar histiocytic sarcoma in a 17-month-old girl.,"The authors report on a case of histiocytic sarcoma (HS) in a pediatric patient presenting with a solitary tumor in the cerebellum, with the aim of providing insight into primary HS in the CNS, which is especially rare. A 17-month-old Japanese girl presented with a 2-week history of progressive gait disturbance. Brain MRI revealed a 4.7 × 4.3 × 4.3-cm well-demarcated solitary mass in the right hemisphere of the cerebellum, initially suggestive of medulloblastoma, ependymoma, or anaplastic astrocytoma. On intraoperative inspection the cerebellar tumor showed intensive dural attachment and was subtotally removed. Histological and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with HS. The patient subsequently received chemotherapy, and her preoperative neurological symptoms improved. Primary HS in the CNS usually demonstrates an aggressive clinical course and is currently considered to have a poor prognosis. The possibility of this rare tumor should be included in the differential diagnosis of localized cerebellar tumors in the pediatric age group.",Kiyoshi K;Mio M;Mariko M;Susumu S;Masaki M;Fuminori F;Tetsu T;Noriko N;Hisato H;Yukichi Y
22745043,Phase 2 trial of pemetrexed in children and adolescents with refractory solid tumors: a Children's Oncology Group study.,"Pemetrexed is a multi-targeted antifolate that inhibits key enzymes involved in nucleotide biosynthesis. We performed a phase 2 trial of pemetrexed in children with refractory or recurrent solid tumors, including CNS tumors, to estimate the response rate and further define its toxicity profile. Pemetrexed, at a dose of 1910 mg/m(2) , was administered as a 10-minute intravenous infusion every 21 days. Patients also received vitamin B(12) , daily multivitamin supplementation, and dexamethasone. A two-stage design (10 + 10) was employed in each of the following disease strata: osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, ependymoma, medulloblastoma/supratentorial PNET, and non-brainstem high-grade glioma. Seventy-two eligible subjects (39 males) were enrolled. Median age was 11 years (range 3-23). Sixty-eight were evaluable for response. The median number of cycles administered was 2 (range 1-13). No complete or partial responses were observed. Stable disease, for a median of 5 (range 4-13) cycles, was observed in five patients (ependymoma, Ewing sarcoma, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma; n = 1 each). Neutropenia (44%), anemia (35%), and elevated alanine transaminase (35%) attributable to pemetrexed were the most commonly recurring toxicities observed in patients receiving multiple cycles. Other toxicities attributed to pemetrexed occurring in ≥10% of cycles included thrombocytopenia (30%), fatigue (18%), nausea (14), hyperglycemia (13%), rash (11%), vomiting (13%), and hypophosphatemia (11%). Pemetrexed, administered as an intravenous infusion every 21 days, was tolerable in children and adolescents with refractory solid tumors, including CNS tumors, but did not show evidence of objective anti-tumor activity in the childhood tumors studied.",Anne B AB;Suman S;Mark M;Allen A;Richard R;Matthew M MM;Stephanie L SL;Peter C PC;Susan M SM
22742590,Medulloblastoma-biology and microenvironment: a review.,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is a cancer of the cerebellum and the most common primary pediatric malignancy of the central nervous system. Classified as a primitive neural ectoderm tumor; it is thought to arise from granule cell precursors in the cerebellum. The standard of care consists of surgery, chemotherapy and age-dependent radiation therapy. Despite aggressive multimodality therapy; approximately 30% of MB patients remain incurable. Moreover, for long-term survivors, the treatment related sequelae are often debilitating. Side effects include cerebellar mutism, sterility, neurocognitive deficits, and a substantial risk of developing secondary cancers. In a quest for more effective and targeted therapies, scientists have begun to investigate the biological events that not only initiate but also sustain the malignant phenotype in MB. Of particular interest is, the role of the tumor microenvironment in tumor pathogenesis. This review seeks to highlight several key processes observed in cancer biology, particularly the involvement of the tumor microenvironment, with relevant examples from MB.",Tiara T;Robert G RG;Nabil N
22741795,In silico prediction of novel inhibitors of the DNA binding activity of FoxG1.,"Forkhead box (Fox) proteins are a superfamily of evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulators, which control a wide spectrum of biological processes. FoxG1 is a transcriptional repressor, whose function has been elucidated recently. FoxG1 overexpression was found to be associated with medulloblastoma and hepatoblastoma. It was suggested that the inhibition of FoxG1 could be a potential target for the development of molecular therapeutics in such type of cancers. Since, experimentally derived structure for FoxG1 is unavailable in any of the structural databases, modeling of the DNA binding domain of this protein was carried out. Potential binding sites on the protein surface were predicted. Pharmacophoric features were derived from the binding site that lies near the protein-DNA binding interface and this pharmacophore was employed for virtual screening of compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pharmacophore model proposed for screening inhibitors of FoxG1, which may interfere with its transcriptional repressor functionality. The interactions of the binding site residues with the top scoring ligand hits were analyzed. These ligands may be used for the development of potential inhibitors of FoxG1 protein.",Syam Bhuvanachandran SB;Shaik Mahammad Abdul SM;Rajanikant Golgodu RG
22736505,Genistein induces growth arrest and suppresses telomerase activity in brain tumor cells.,"Genistein, a soy isoflavone, has been reported to exhibit multiple effects, such as inducing cell cycle arrest, triggering apoptosis, inhibiting the activation of NF(K) B and inactivating several signaling cascades in human cancer cells. In vivo studies demonstrating antiangiogenesis and antimetastatic effects of genistein have also been reported. Here, we demonstrate that genistein inhibits the growth of glioblastoma multiforme and medulloblastoma cells with different TP53 mutations and radio-responses by arresting the cells at G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The cell cycle arrest was found to be independent of DNA damage and such an arrest was sustainable for at least 10 days even after drug removal. Annexin V staining revealed absence of apoptotic or necrotic cell populations after genistein treatment. This supports the observation that genistein induces insignificant DNA damage and indicates that the cell cycle arrest triggered does not lead to cell death. Gene and protein expression studies reveal similar changes in the same pathways following treatment in the cell types tested. Genistein was also able to inhibit telomerase activity resulting in telomere shortening. Thus, we demonstrate, for the first time, that genistein induces growth arrest in association with telomerase inhibition in brain tumor cells via the suppression of TR- and TERT mRNA. By elucidating the mechanisms of anticancer effects after genistein treatment in brain tumor cells, there will be a premise for the incorporation of genistein dietary sources to complement radiotherapy in brain tumor patients.",Aik Kia AK;Jacklyn Wei Yan JW;Guruprasad G;M Prakash MP

22723427,EphB2 activity plays a pivotal role in pediatric medulloblastoma cell adhesion and invasion.,"Eph/ephrin signaling has been implicated in various types of key cancer-enhancing processes, like migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis. In medulloblastoma, invading tumor cells characteristically lead to early recurrence and a decreased prognosis. Based on kinase-activity profiling data published recently, we hypothesized a key role for the Eph/ephrin signaling system in medulloblastoma invasion. In primary medulloblastoma samples, a significantly higher expression of EphB2 and the ligand ephrin-B1 was observed compared with normal cerebellum. Furthermore, medulloblastoma cell lines showed high expression of EphA2, EphB2, and EphB4. Stimulation of medulloblastoma cells with ephrin-B1 resulted in a marked decrease in in vitro cell adhesion and an increase in the invasion capacity of cells expressing high levels of EphB2. The cell lines that showed an ephrin-B1-induced phenotype possessed increased levels of phosphorylated EphB2 and, to a lesser extent, EphB4 after stimulation. Knockdown of EphB2 expression by short hairpin RNA completely abolished ephrin ligand-induced effects on adhesion and migration. Analysis of signal transduction identified p38, Erk, and mTOR as downstream signaling mediators potentially inducing the ephrin-B1 phenotype. In conclusion, the observed deregulation of Eph/ephrin expression in medulloblastoma enhances the invasive phenotype, suggesting a potential role in local tumor cell invasion and the formation of metastases.",Arend H AH;Wilfred F A WF;Esther E;Dannis G DG;Guillermo G;Hui H;Frank J G FJ;Kim R KR;Eelco W EW;Willem A WA;Sander H SH;Maikel P MP;Eveline S J M ES
22722829,Novel mutations target distinct subgroups of medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma is a malignant childhood brain tumour comprising four discrete subgroups. Here, to identify mutations that drive medulloblastoma, we sequenced the entire genomes of 37 tumours and matched normal blood. One-hundred and thirty-six genes harbouring somatic mutations in this discovery set were sequenced in an additional 56 medulloblastomas. Recurrent mutations were detected in 41 genes not yet implicated in medulloblastoma; several target distinct components of the epigenetic machinery in different disease subgroups, such as regulators of H3K27 and H3K4 trimethylation in subgroups 3 and 4 (for example, KDM6A and ZMYM3), and CTNNB1-associated chromatin re-modellers in WNT-subgroup tumours (for example, SMARCA4 and CREBBP). Modelling of mutations in mouse lower rhombic lip progenitors that generate WNT-subgroup tumours identified genes that maintain this cell lineage (DDX3X), as well as mutated genes that initiate (CDH1) or cooperate (PIK3CA) in tumorigenesis. These data provide important new insights into the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma subgroups and highlight targets for therapeutic development.",Giles G;Matthew M;Tanya A TA;Charles C;Xiang X;Li L;Timothy N TN;Erin E;Lei L;Xiaoyan X;Nader N;Suzanne J SJ;Robert R;Richard R;Natasha N;Radhika R;Jianmin J;Gang G;Michael M;Xin X;Jared J;Pankaj P;Jing J;John J;Bhavin B;Arzu A;Tong T;Shaoyi S;Stanley S;Steven S;David D;Daisuke D;Martine F MF;David D;David W DW;Ching C CC;Eric E;Tim T;Sridharan S;Richard R;Robert S RS;Lucinda L LL;David J DJ;Kerri K;Amar A;Elaine R ER;Richard K RK;James R JR;Jinghui J;Richard J RJ
22710714,"Bax deficiency prolongs cerebellar neurogenesis, accelerates medulloblastoma formation and paradoxically increases both malignancy and differentiation.","Neurogenesis requires negative regulation through differentiation of progenitors or their programmed cell death (PCD). Growth regulation is particularly important in the postnatal cerebellum, where excessive progenitor proliferation promotes medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor in children. We present evidence that PCD operates alongside differentiation to regulate cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) and to prevent medulloblastoma. Here, we show that genetic deletion of pro-apoptotic Bax disrupts regulation of cerebellar neurogenesis and promotes medulloblastoma formation. In Bax(-/-) mice, the period of neurogenesis was extended into the third week of postnatal life, and ectopic neurons and progenitors collected in the molecular layer of the cerebellum and adjacent tectum. Importantly, genetic deletion of Bax in medulloblastoma-prone ND2:SmoA1 transgenic mice greatly accelerated tumorigenesis. Bax-deficient medulloblastomas exhibited strikingly distinct pathology, with reduced apoptosis, increased neural differentiation and tectal migration. Comparing Bax(+/+) and Bax(-/-) medulloblastomas, we were able to identify upregulation of Bcl-2 and nuclear exclusion of p27 as tumorigenic changes that are required to mitigate the tumor suppressive effect of Bax. Studies on human tumors confirmed the importance of modulating Bax in medulloblastoma pathogenesis. Our results demonstrate that Bax-dependent apoptosis regulates postnatal cerebellar neurogenesis, suppresses medulloblastoma formation and imposes selective pressure on tumors that form. Functional resistance to Bax-mediated apoptosis, required for medulloblastoma tumorigenesis, may be a tumor-specific vulnerability to be exploited for therapeutic benefit.",I I;A J AJ;V V;C R CR;M M;T R TR
22707305,MT1-MMP expression level status dictates the in vitro action of lupeol on inflammatory biomarkers MMP-9 and COX-2 in medulloblastoma cells.,"Local inflammation-induced extracellular matrix structural changes are a prerequisite to neoplastic invasion by pediatric intracranial tumors. Accordingly, increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, two inflammation-induced matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), may further aid the transformed cells either to infiltrate adjacent tissues or to enter the peripheral circulation. In the context of neuroinflammation, MMP-9 has been linked to processes such as blood-brain barrier opening and invasion of neural tissue by blood-derived immune cells. Given its reported anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties, we investigated the in vitro pharmacological effects of lupeol, a diet-derived triterpenoid, on MMP-9 and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expressions in a pediatric medulloblastoma DAOY cell line model. Lupeol was unable to inhibit the increased MMP-9 and COX-2 expression in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-treated cells, but was rather found to synergize with PMA to induce both biomarkers' expression. A contribution of the membrane type-1 (MT1)-MMP was also revealed, since lupeol/PMA treatments triggered proMMP-2 activation, and that MT1-MMP gene silencing reversed the combined effects of lupeol/PMA on both MMP-9 and COX-2. The mRNA stabilizing factor HuR was also found increased in the combined lupeol/PMA treatment, suggesting stabilization processes of the MMP-9 and COX-2 transcripts. We postulate that lupeol's anti-inflammatory properties may exert better pharmacological action within low MT1-MMP expressing tumors. Furthermore, these evidences add up to the new pleiotropic molecular mechanisms of action of MT1-MMP, and prompt for evaluating the future in vitro pharmacological properties of lupeol under pro-inflammatory experimental set-up.",Borhane B;Eric E;Richard R
22706201,MAX and MYC: a heritable breakup.,"The overexpression of MYC, which occurs in many tumors, dramatically disrupts the equilibrium between activation and repression of the oncogenic MYC/MYC-associated protein X (MAX)/MAX dimerization protein 1 (MXD1) network, favoring MYC-MAX complexes and thereby impairing differentiation and promoting cell growth. Although for some time it has appeared that MAX is necessary for both the activation and repression of the axis, recent evidence shows that MYC retains considerable biologic function in the absence of MAX. The presence of germline MAX mutations in patients with hereditary pheochromocytoma supports the predominant role of MAX as a negative regulator of the network and suggests that MYC deregulation plays a role in hereditary cancer predisposition. This finding also confirms the importance of impairment of the MYC/MAX/MXD1 axis in the development of aggressive neural tumors, because MYCN overexpression is an established genetic hallmark of malign neuroblastoma, and it is likely that MXI1 plays a relevant role in the development of medulloblastoma and glioblastoma. Finally, the likely malignant behavior of tumors with mutations in MAX points to MYC as a candidate therapeutic target in the treatment of metastatic pheochromocytoma.",Alberto A;Mercedes M

22702330,Anaplastic medulloblastoma in a child with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,"A 9-year-old boy with known Duchenne type muscular dystrophy (DMD) presented with signs of increased intracranial pressure. Radiological investigations revealed a lesion in the midline of the posterior fossa. Subtotal resection was performed. Pathology findings were consistent with the diagnosis of anaplastic medulloblastoma. The postoperative lumbar CSF was positive for malignant cells. Postoperatively, the patient showed severe neurological deterioration and lost his capacity to walk. He was treated with craniospinal radiation followed by nonintensive chemotherapy. At 30 months postsurgery, he was still in complete remission but had not recovered his walking ability. This is the second report of a malignant brain tumor in a boy with DMD.

22702213,Growth hormone receptor expression in brain tumors.,"Growth hormone (GH) is essential for quality of life in both children and adults, but it is also believed to enhance the growth of various neoplasms. However, the role of GH in the brain, particularly in brain tumors, has yet to be established. To clarify these problems from the perspective of receptor expression, we examined GH receptor (GHR) expression in brain tumors using immunohistochemistry and the correlation between GHR expression and clinical features. Surgical specimens obtained from patients with brain tumors (106 pituitary adenomas, 12 craniopharyngiomas, 13 germ cell tumors, 6 medulloblastomas, and 12 malignant gliomas) were examined immunohistochemically for GHR expression. The GHR positive rate was lower in malignant tumors than in benign tumors (59% in pituitary adenomas, 73% in craniopharyngiomas, 23% in germ cell tumors, and 0% in medulloblastomas and gliomas). GHR staining in pituitary adenomas was weaker than that in normal pituitary gland. Among the GH-producing pituitary adenomas, there was no difference in size between GHR-positive and -negative tumors. However, among the non-GH-producing adenomas, GHR-positive tumors were significantly smaller. Thus, immunohistochemical GHR expression may have, at least in part, a negative impact on tumor growth potential in brain tumors.",Tetsuhiko T;Seiji S;Atsushi A;Yasuyuki Y;Kazuhiko K;Kazunori K;Kaoru K
22701651,REST controls self-renewal and tumorigenic competence of human glioblastoma cells.,"The Repressor Element 1 Silencing Transcription factor (REST/NRSF) is a master repressor of neuronal programs in non-neuronal lineages shown to function as a central regulator of developmental programs and stem cell physiology. Aberrant REST function has been associated with a number of pathological conditions. In cancer biology, REST has been shown to play a tumor suppressor activity in epithelial cancers but an oncogenic role in brain childhood malignancies such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. Here we examined REST expression in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) specimens and its role in GBM cells carrying self-renewal and tumorigenic competence. We found REST to be expressed in GBM specimens, its presence being particularly enriched in tumor cells in the perivascular compartment. Significantly, REST is highly expressed in self-renewing tumorigenic-competent GBM cells and its knock down strongly reduces their self-renewal in vitro and tumor-initiating capacity in vivo and affects levels of miR-124 and its downstream targets. These results indicate that REST contributes to GBM maintenance by affecting its self-renewing and tumorigenic cellular component and that, hence, a better understanding of these circuitries in these cells might lead to new exploitable therapeutic targets.",Luciano L;Laura L;Valentina V;Monica M;Elisa E;Paola P;Franco F;Lorenzo L;Davide D;Elena E
22696229,EZH2-regulated DAB2IP is a medulloblastoma tumor suppressor and a positive marker for survival.,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Despite recent improvements, the molecular mechanisms driving medulloblastoma are not fully understood and further elucidation could provide cues to improve outcome prediction and therapeutic approaches. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of mouse and human medulloblastoma gene expression data sets, to identify potential medulloblastoma tumor suppressor genes. We identified DAB2IP, a member of the RAS-GTPase-activating protein family (RAS GAP), and showed that DAB2IP expression is repressed in medulloblastoma by EZH2-induced trimethylation. Moreover, we observed that reduced DAB2IP expression correlates significantly with a poor overall survival of patients with medulloblastoma, independent of metastatic stage. Finally, we showed that ectopic DAB2IP expression enhances stress-induced apoptosis in medulloblastoma cells and that reduced expression of DAB2IP in medulloblastoma cells conveys resistance to irradiation-induced cell death. These results suggest that repression of DAB2IP may at least partly protect medulloblastoma cells from apoptotic cell death. Moreover, DAB2IP may represent a molecular marker to distinguish patients with medulloblastoma at high risk from those with a longer survival prognosis.",Michiel M;Sjoerd S;Esther E;Dennis D;Dannis G DG;Marcel M;Christine C;Eleonora E;W Peter WP;David P DP;Thomas T
22693015,Histological variants of medulloblastoma are the most powerful clinical prognostic indicators.,"Medulloblastoma histological classification has gained in importance and newer treatment protocols will include histology stratification. We centrally reviewed medulloblastoma cases from past 10 years reassessing their histology to ascertain its prognostic significance. Samples from 125 consecutive patients (99 males; 10 under age 3 years) were reviewed according to the two WHO classifications of 2000/2007. Eighty-two patients did not have metastases, the primary tumor was completely resected in 101. The median follow-up was 96 months. Treatment was: our institutional protocol, that is, hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (HART), for 39 non-metastatic cases up to 2003; according to the European PNET IV protocol in 31 cases; a HART-based strategy in 39 metastatic cases; tailored to the age below 3 years and based on high-dose chemotherapy in 10; and tailored to the patients conditions in 7. The 5-year PFS/OS rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. Histology was classic in 93 cases, nodular/desmoplastic in 20, anaplastic/large-cell in 9, and with extensive nodularity (MBEN) in 3. Stratification by residual disease after resection, metastases, age, or protocols was not prognostic. Histology suggested 5-year PFS rates of 82% for the desmoplastic and MBEN variants, 78% for classic medulloblastoma, 44% for the anaplastic/large-cell variants (P = 0.01). Multivariable analysis demonstrated statistically significant difference in PFS by histology (P = 0.02), due to the poor prognosis of anaplastic/large-cell medulloblastoma. Tailoring treatments to known risk factors cancelled all prognostic differences, except for anaplasia (not considered as such within previous trials) which proved the most powerful prognostic factor, warranting appropriate treatment intensification.",Maura M;Manila M;Lorenza L;Rosalba R;Bianca B;Veronica V;Elisabetta E;Francesca Romana FR;Filippo F;Paola P;Felice F

Unstimulated whole saliva samples were obtained from 115 children without cancer (control) and 32 children with cancer (CA). Children with cancer were also evaluated after antineoplasic treatment (CAT, n = 17). The salivary concentrations of glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), urea, insulin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), levothyroxine (T4), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) were determined. Acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and Hodgkin's lymphoma were the most frequent cancers, although cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, osteosarcoma, nephroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and endodermal sinus tumor were also observed. The salivary concentration of cholesterol, triglycerides, or GGT did not differ between groups. Instead, the concentrations of alkaline phosphatase and T4 were higher in patients with cancer, irrespective of treatment. TSH levels were higher in the CA group and urea concentration was lower in the CAT group. T3 was undetectable in all groups. Antineoplasic treatment increased the glucose level and decreased the insulin concentration. Salivary concentration of total IgA was lower in children with cancer, irrespective of treatment. Cancer and antineoplasic treatment affected biochemical and immunological parameters in the saliva of children, shedding new light on the potential usefulness of saliva for monitoring children with cancer, especially to patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.",Rosane N M RN;Joao J JJ;Jose Carlos E JC;Silvana A SA;Monica V V MV;Deborah B S DB;Carolina X L CX;Cristina C;Flavia Raquel F FR;Antonio Luiz A AL

22682621,Multiple CDK/CYCLIND genes are amplified in medulloblastoma and supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal brain tumor.,"Embryonal brain tumors, which include medulloblastoma and the more aggressive supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (sPNET), comprise one of the largest group of malignant pediatric brain tumors. We observed in high resolution array comparative genomic hybridization and polymerase chain reaction analyses that several different components of the CDK/CYCLIND/pRB regulatory complex, including the CDK4/6 and CCND1/2 loci, are targets of gene amplification in medulloblastoma and sPNET. CDK6 and CCND1 gene amplification were respectively most common and robust, and overall CDK/CYCLIND gene amplification was more commonly observed in sPNET (25%) than medulloblastoma (1-5%). CDK6 overexpression enhanced in vitro and in vivo oncogenicity and endogenous CDK6 or CCND1 knockdown decreased pRB phosphorylation and impaired cell cycle progression in both medulloblastoma and sPNET cell lines. Although animal models implicate the pRB tumor suppressor pathway in medulloblastoma and sPNET, mutations of RB1 or the related INK4 tumor suppressor loci are rare in primary human tumors. Our data suggest that CDK/CYCLIND gene amplification may represent important mechanisms for functional inactivation of pRB in medulloblastoma and sPNET.",Meihua M;Will W;Maria M;Paul P;Young Shing YS;Eric E;Maisa M;James T JT;Hai H;Michael D MD;Charles C;Cynthia E CE;Wan W;Jeremy A JA;Annie A
22679179,Vismodegib.,"Vismodegib (GDC-0449), an orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling, was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma that is either metastatic or locally advanced in patients who are not candidates for surgical resection or radiation. Given the absence of previously defined effective drug therapy for this disease, approval was granted primarily on the basis of outcome of a nonrandomized parallel cohort phase II study of 99 patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma, with a primary endpoint of objective response rate. Response rates of 30.3% and 42.9% were observed in metastatic and locally advanced cohorts in this study, respectively, associated with median progression-free survival in both cohorts of 9.5 months.

High-dose methotrexate (MTX) has showed to increase the surveillance in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other neoplasms. However, MTX may induce significant neurotoxicity. AIM. To evaluate, in our population of patients who have been treated with MTX, the incidence of neurotoxicity and to describe its main clinical and radiological characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS. We retrospectively review the patients who received treatment with systemic high-dose MTX and/or intrathecal MTX between 1994 and 2010. The children who presented clinical o radiological signs of neurotoxicity were reviewed. RESULTS. We identified 284 patients who received high-dose intravenous and/or intrathecal MTX. 9 patients presented neurotoxicity. The median age at diagnosis was 6 years; 6 patients were male. The diagnosis included: 6 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 2 medulloblastoma and 1 lymphoma. 66% patients presented focal neurological dysfunction, 3 had non-specific symptoms. In 5 patients the symptomatology started the first 14 days after the MTX administration. 8 patients had complete clinical resolution, but only one presented neurological long term effects. All the patients except one showed signs of acute leukoencephalopathy in the brain MR study. These alterations resolved one year later in 3 patients; in the other patients the MR alterations persisted. The neurotoxicity management was corticosteroid, folinic acid, aminophylline and dextromethorphan. CONCLUSION. The MTX neurotoxicity it can present as acute or chronic. It has a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from sub-clinical manifestations with complete recovery to a chronic and progressive encephalopathy.",Montserrat M;M Carmen MC;Susana S;Rubén R;Ofelia O;Jaume J
22669335,"Additive effects of vorinostat and MLN8237 in pediatric leukemia, medulloblastoma, and neuroblastoma cell lines.","Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, such as vorinostat, decrease Aurora kinase activity by a variety of mechanisms. Vorinostat and MLN8237, a selective Aurora A kinase inhibitor, disrupt the spindle assembly and the mitotic checkpoint at different points, suggesting that the combination could have increased antitumor activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the cytotoxicity of vorinostat and MLN8237 in pediatric tumor cell lines. Cell survival was measured after 72 h of drug treatment using a modified methyl tetrazolium assay. For drug combination experiments, cells were exposed to medium alone (controls), single drug alone, or to different concentrations of the combination of the two drugs, for a total of 36 concentration pairs per plate. The interaction of the drug combination was analyzed using the universal response surface approach. The cells express the target of MLN8237, Aurora A. For each cell line, the single agent IC(50) for MLN8237 and for vorinostat was in the clinically relevant range. Both drugs inhibited cell survival in a concentration-dependent fashion. At concentrations of MLN8237 exceeding approximately 1 μM, there was a paradoxical increase in viability signal in all three lines that may be explained by inhibition of Aurora B kinase. The combination of MLN8237 and vorinostat showed additive cytotoxicity in all three cell lines and nearly abrogated the paradoxical increase in survival noted at high single-agent MLN8237 concentrations. MLN8237 and vorinostat are active in vitro against cancer cell lines. These results provide important preclinical support for the development of future clinical studies of MLN8237and vorinostat.",Jodi A JA;Kathleen A KA;Linna L;Jeffrey A JA;Stacey L SL
22665539,Outcome of children with metastatic medulloblastoma treated with carboplatin during craniospinal radiotherapy: a Children's Oncology Group Phase I/II study.,"We evaluated the feasibility of administering carboplatin as a radiosensitizer during craniospinal radiation therapy (CSRT) to patients with high-risk medulloblastomas (MBs) and supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and we report the outcome in the subset with metastatic (M+) MB. After surgery, patients received 36 Gy CSRT with boosts to sites of disease. During radiation, patients received 15 to 30 doses of carboplatin (30-45 mg/m(2)/dose), along with vincristine (VCR) once per week for 6 weeks. Patients on regimen A received 6 months of maintenance chemotherapy (MC) with cyclophosphamide and VCR. Once the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of carboplatin was determined, cisplatin was added to the MC (regimen B). In all, 161 eligible patients (median age, 8.7 years; range, 3.1 to 21.6 years) were enrolled. Myelosuppression was dose limiting and 35 mg/m(2)/dose × 30 was determined to be the RP2D of carboplatin. Twenty-nine (36%) of 81 patients with M+ MB had diffuse anaplasia. Four patients were taken off study within 11 months of completing radiotherapy for presumed metastatic progression and are long-term survivors following palliative chemotherapy. Excluding these four patients, 5-year overall survival ± SE and progression-free survival ± SE for M+ patients treated at the RP2D on regimen A was 82% ± 9% and 71% ± 11% versus 68% ± 10% and 59% ± 10% on regimen B (P = .36). There was no difference in survival by M stage. Anaplasia was a negative predictor of outcome. The use of carboplatin as a radiosensitizer is a promising strategy for patients with M+ MB.

22665064,The deubiquitylase USP37 links REST to the control of p27 stability and cell proliferation.,"The RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST) is a repressor of neuronal differentiation and its elevated expression in neural cells blocks neuronal differentiation. In this study, we demonstrate a role for REST in the control of proliferation of medulloblastoma cells. REST expression decreased the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)NIB/p27, a CDK inhibitor and a brake of cell proliferation in these cells. The reciprocal relationship between REST and p27 was validated in human tumor samples. REST knockdown in medulloblastoma cells derepessed a novel REST target gene encoding the deubiquitylase ubiquitin (Ub)-specific peptidase 37 (USP37). Ectopically expressed wild-type USP37 formed a complex with p27, promoted its deubiquitination and stabilization and blocked cell proliferation. Knockdown of REST and USP37 prevented p27 stabilization and blocked the diminution in proliferative potential that normally accompanied REST loss. Unexpectedly, wild-type USP37 expression also induced the expression of REST-target neuronal differentiation genes even though REST levels were unaffected. In contrast, a mutant of USP37 carrying a site-directed change in a conserved cysteine failed to rescue REST-mediated p27 destabilization, maintenance of cell proliferation and blockade to neuronal differentiation. Consistent with these findings, a significant correlation between USP37 and p27 was observed in patient tumors. Collectively, these findings provide a novel connection between REST and the proteasomal machinery in the control of p27 and cell proliferation in medulloblastoma cells.",C M CM;P P;M M;A A;D D;G G;L L;J J;V V;S S;C C;V V
22662310,mGlu Receptors and Cancerous Growth.,"G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) represent a class of therapeutic targets that have been widely exploited for drug designs and development. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) belong to Class C GPCRs and are predominantly involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS). The surprising accumulating evidence suggesting other functional roles of mGluRs in human malignancies in addition to synaptic transmission has presented intriguing possibilities to make mGluRs putative novel targets for human cancers. Since our group first described the aberrant expression of mGluR1 as the driving force in melanomagenesis in transgenic mouse models, other subtypes of mGluRs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various cancer types such as malignant gliomas and medulloblastomas. As such, increased efforts have been generated to elucidate the mechanisms by which mGluRs confer oncogenic potentials. Current knowledge on the participation of various mGluRs in several human cancers suggests that mGluRs are ""druggable"" members of the GPCR superfamily and their oncogenic implications in cancer, so further understanding on anti-mGluR strategies will be beneficial.",Jessica J;Suzie S
22661588,Antioxidant enzyme polymorphisms and neuropsychological outcomes in medulloblastoma survivors: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,"Psychological or neurocognitive impairment is often seen in medulloblastoma survivors after craniospinal radiation; however, significant variability in outcomes exists. This study investigated the role of antioxidant enzyme polymorphisms in moderating this outcome and hypothesized that patients who had polymorphisms associated with lower antioxidant enzyme function would have a higher occurrence of impairment. From the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) cohort, 109 medulloblastoma survivors and 143 siblings were identified who completed the CCSS Neurocognitive Questionnaire (NCQ) and the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18) and who provided buccal DNA samples. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allelic discrimination was used for SOD2 (rs4880), GPX1 (rs1050450), and GSTP1 (rs1695 and rs1138272) genotyping and PCR for GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene deletions. Outcomes on NCQ and BSI-18 subscale scores were examined in association with genotypes and clinical factors, including age at diagnosis, sex, and radiation dose, using univariate and multivariate analysis of variance. Patients <7 years of age at diagnosis displayed more problems with task efficiency (P < .001) and fewer problems with somatic complaints (P = .004) than did patients ≥7 years of age. Female patients reported more organization problems than did male patients (P = .02). Patients with homozygous GSTM1 gene deletion reported higher anxiety (mean null genotype = 47.3 ± 9.2, non-null = 43.9 ± 7.8; P = .04), more depression (null = 51.0 ± 9.8, non-null = 47.0 ± 9.4; P = .03), and more global distress (null = 50.2 ± 9.7, non-null = 45.2 ± 9.9; P = .01). All associations for the GSTM1 polymorphism remained statistically significant in a multivariate model controlling for age, sex, and radiation dose. Homozygous GSTM1 gene deletion was consistently associated with greater psychological distress in medulloblastoma survivors across multiple domains, suggesting that this genotype may predispose patients for increased emotional late effects.",Julienne J;Kevin R KR;Michael E ME;Wei W;Deo Kumar DK;Marilyn M;Thomas E TE;Roger J RJ;Leslie L LL;M Fatih MF
22658965,[Stereotactic radiotherapy in pediatric indications].,"Stereotactic radiotherapy is a very high precision procedure, which has been limited to radiosurgery for a long time. Technological improvements allowed the development of radiotherapy in stereotactic conditions, leading to a lot of innovations. Previously indicated for cerebral pathologies, this procedure is now developed for extracerebral locations. In paediatrics, stereotactic radiotherapy is still limited, delivered precociously, due to the possibility of long-term late effects that needs to be addressed. This review reports the different useful conditions, technical evolutions, and the current validated paediatric indications, with differences from adults, and future directions.",V V;S S;C C;S S
28517525,MO-A-213AB-08: 2D Water Equivalent Path Length Imaging Technique for Pre-Treatment Range Verification in Proton Therapy.,"To assess the potentials of a novel detector for providing a transmission image of the patient in terms of the Water Equivalent Path Length (WEPL) values and to evaluate the detector potential for real-time imaging of moving targets. The method is based on the principle that for passively scattered proton beams the WEPL of any point located in the dose plateau of a spread-out Bragg-Peak can be derived from the time dependence of the dose rate function measured at this point. A flat-panel 2D detector array (Sun Nuclear Corporation, 249 diodes, pitch ∼6 mm, 2 ms time resolution) was placed distal to a range of phantoms with varying complexities. The dose rate received by all diodes were measured as functions of time and analyzed to obtain the WEPL values. To assess the potential real-time features of this imaging technique, a Lucite cube was imaged while moving with a sinusoidal pattern with the amplitude and period comparable to a typical mobile tumor. In water tanks, millimeter accuracy in the determination of the WEPL could be achieved and the geometrical shape of wedge and sphere phantoms could be reproduced. In more complex phantoms such as a Lucite step-like compensator or Medulloblastoma patient compensators, multiple Coulomb scattering and range mixing cause a slight deterioration in the reconstruction of the WEPL. We found that tracking of a moving target in the coronal plane is potentially feasible. The technique gives less than 1 cGy of dose to patients and is therefore ideal for 'range-tuning' prior to treatment. For clinical applications, the beam for 'tuning' will need a deeper range than the prescription and once the radiological path length to the dosimeter is determined and compared with that from planning, the proton range for the actual treatment can be adjusted.",M M;H H;M M;H H;H H
28517324,SU-E-T-257: Risk of Radiogenic Second Cancer after Photon and Proton Craniospinal Irradiation.,"To compare proton and photon therapies in terms of the risks of second cancers for a pediatric medulloblastoma patient receiving craniospinal irradiation (CSI). Two CSI treatment plans with 23.4 Gy or Gy (RBE) prescribed dose were computed for a 4-year-old boy withmedulloblastoma: a three-field 6-MV photon therapy plan and a four-field proton therapy plan. The primary doses for both plans were determined using a commercial treatment planning system. Stray radiation doses for proton therapy were determined from Monte Carlo simulations, and stray radiation doses for photon therapy were determined from measured data. The dose-risk model based on Biological Effects of Ionization Radiation VII report was used to estimate risk of second cancer. Baseline predictions of the relative risk of each organ were always less for proton CSI than for photon CSI after various follow-up years for the patient. The lifetime risks of the incidence of second cancer after proton CSI and photon CSI were 7.7% and 92%, respectively, and the ratio of lifetime risk was 0.083. Uncertainty analysis revealed the qualitative findings of this study were insensitive to any plausible changes of dose-risk models and mean neutron radiation weighting factor. Proton therapy confers lower predicted risk of second cancer for the pediatric medulloblastoma patient compared with photon therapy.",R R;R R;A A;P P;A A;W W
22647080,Two case study evaluations of an arts-based social skills intervention for adolescents with childhood brain disorder.,"Arts-based programmes have been shown to be useful for individuals with disturbances in cognitive and behavioural functioning. The current case studies examined the feasibility and effectiveness of a theatre skills training programme to facilitate social skills and participation for adolescents with childhood brain disorder. A case study approach was used with two adolescent participants. Focus groups were conducted immediately post-intervention, while a battery of quantitative measures were administered pre- and post-treatment, as well as 8 months post-treatment. Perceived and documented improvements in social skills and participation were observed from pre- to post-intervention and at follow-up. Results support the use of an arts-based intervention for youth with brain injuries to facilitate social skills and participation. Findings also highlight the need for more sensitive measures of these skills for youth with childhood brain disorder, who may have impaired awareness of their abilities and/or impairments in memory and language comprehension.",Sabrina S;Julia J;Angela A;Helene H;Debra D;Catherine C;Peter P;Michelle M
22641694,Formation of telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) foci in highly proliferating mouse cerebellar neuronal progenitors and medulloblastoma.,"Telomeres play crucial roles in the maintenance of genome integrity and control of cellular senescence. Most eukaryotic telomeres can be transcribed to generate a telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) that persists as a heterogeneous nuclear RNA and can be developmentally regulated. However, the precise function and regulation of TERRA in normal and cancer cell development remains poorly understood. Here, we show that TERRA accumulates in highly proliferating normal and cancer cells, and forms large nuclear foci, which are distinct from previously characterized markers of DNA damage or replication stress. Using a mouse model for medulloblastoma driven by chronic Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, TERRA RNA was detected in tumor, but not adjacent normal cells using both RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and northern blotting. RNA FISH revealed the formation of TERRA foci (TERFs) in the nuclear regions of rapidly proliferating tumor cells. In the normal developing cerebellum, TERRA aggregates could also be detected in highly proliferating zones of progenitor neurons. SHH could enhance TERRA expression in purified granule progenitor cells in vitro, suggesting that proliferation signals contribute to TERRA expression in responsive tissue. TERRA foci did not colocalize with γH2AX foci, promyelocytic leukemia (PML) or Cajal bodies in mouse tumor tissue. We also provide evidence that TERRA is elevated in a variety of human cancers. These findings suggest that elevated TERRA levels reflect a novel early form of telomere regulation during replication stress and cancer cell evolution, and the TERRA RNA aggregates may form a novel nuclear body in highly proliferating mammalian cells.",Zhong Z;Zhuo Z;Chaomei C;Aliah A;Valérie V;Jose J;Xiaowei X;Paul M PM;Nadia N
22633624,Phase II study of vinorelbine and continuous low doses cyclophosphamide in children and young adults with a relapsed or refractory malignant solid tumour: good tolerance profile and efficacy in rhabdomyosarcoma--a report from the Société Française des Cancers et leucémies de l'Enfant et de l'adolescent (SFCE).,"This phase II study evaluated efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of combination intravenous vinorelbine (VNL) and continuous low doses oral cyclophosphamide (CPM) combination in children and young adults with a recurrent or refractory solid tumour. A total of 117 patients (median age, 12 years) within six disease strata received intravenous VNL 25mg/m(2) on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle combined with continuous daily oral CPM 25mg/m(2). Tumour response was assessed every two cycles according to WHO (World Health Organisation) criteria. PK of VNL was investigated in a subset of 18 patients aged 4-15 years. In rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) (n=50), the best overall response rate (ORR) was 36% with four complete (8%) and 14 partial responses (28%). The best ORR was 13% in Ewing's sarcoma (n=15), 6% in non-RMS soft tissue sarcoma (n=16) and 6% in neuroblastoma (n=16). No response was observed in osteosarcoma (n=10) and medulloblastoma (n=7). The main grade 3/4 toxicity was neutropenia (38%). Other severe toxicities were limited with 3% of peripheral neuropathy and no haemorrhagic cystitis. The PK analysis revealed equivalent blood exposure to VNL between children >4 years and adult series when the VNL dose was based on the body surface area-based dosing. In heavily pre-treated children, VNL combined with CPM showed an interesting response rate in RMS and an acceptable toxicity profile supporting further evaluation of these agents in phase III trials.",Véronique V;Jean-Laurent JL;Laurent L;Angelo A;Daniel D;Christophe C;Anne-Sophie AS;Nicolas N;Nadège N;Claudine C;Marie-Dominique MD;Pascale P;Nicolas N;Gisele G;Birgit B;Odile O
22629485,Radiation associated tumors following therapeutic cranial radiation.,"A serious, albeit rare, sequel of therapeutic ionizing radiotherapy is delayed development of a new, histologically distinct neoplasm within the radiation field. We identified 27 cases, from a 10-year period, of intracranial tumors arising after cranial irradiation. The original lesions for which cranial radiation was used for treatment included: tinea capitis (1), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 5), sarcoma (1), scalp hemangioma (1), cranial nerve schwannoma (1) and primary (13) and metastatic (1) brain tumors, pituitary tumor (1), germinoma (1), pinealoma (1), and unknown histology (1). Dose of cranial irradiation ranged from 1800 to 6500 cGy, with a mean of 4596 cGy. Age at cranial irradiation ranged from 1 month to 43 years, with a mean of 13.4 years. Latency between radiotherapy and diagnosis of a radiation-induced neoplasm ranged from 4 to 47 years (mean 18.8 years). Radiation-induced tumors included: meningiomas (14), sarcomas (7), malignant astrocytomas (4), and medulloblastomas (2). Data were analyzed to evaluate possible correlations between gender, age at irradiation, dose of irradiation, latency, use of chemotherapy, and radiation-induced neoplasm histology. Significant correlations existed between age at cranial irradiation and development of either a benign neoplasm (mean age 8.5 years) versus a malignant neoplasm (mean age 20.3; P = 0.012), and development of either a meningioma (mean age 7.0 years) or a sarcoma (mean age 27.4 years; P = 0.0001). There was also a significant positive correlation between latency and development of either a meningioma (mean latency 21.8 years) or a sarcoma (mean latency 7.7 years; P = 0.001). The correlation between dose of cranial irradiation and development of either a meningioma (mean dose 4128 cGy) or a sarcoma (mean dose 5631 cGy) approached significance (P = 0.059). Our study is the first to show that younger patients had a longer latency period and were more likely to have lower-grade lesions (e.g. meningiomas) as a secondary neoplasm, while older patients had a shorter latency period and were more likely to have higher-grade lesions (e.g. sarcomas).",Abhineet A;Alex M AM;Lindsay L;Robert C RC;Jason K JK;Daniel L DL
22628409,Gene signatures associated with mouse postnatal hindbrain neural stem cells and medulloblastoma cancer stem cells identify novel molecular mediators and predict human medulloblastoma molecular classification.,"Medulloblastoma arises from mutations occurring in stem/progenitor cells located in restricted hindbrain territories. Here we report that the mouse postnatal ventricular zone lining the IV ventricle also harbors bona fide stem cells that, remarkably, share the same molecular profile with cerebellar white matter-derived neural stem cells (NSC). To identify novel molecular mediators involved in medulloblastomagenesis, we compared these distinct postnatal hindbrain-derived NSC populations, which are potentially tumor initiating, with murine compound Ptch/p53 mutant medulloblastoma cancer stem cells (CSC) that faithfully phenocopy the different variants of human medulloblastoma in vivo. Transcriptome analysis of both hindbrain NSCs and medulloblastoma CSCs resulted in the generation of well-defined gene signatures, each reminiscent of a specific human medulloblastoma molecular subclass. Most interestingly, medulloblastoma CSCs upregulated developmentally related genes, such as Ebfs, that were shown to be highly expressed in human medulloblastomas and play a pivotal role in experimental medullo-blastomagenesis. These data indicate that gene expression analysis of medulloblastoma CSCs holds great promise not only for understanding functional differences between distinct CSC populations but also for identifying meaningful signatures that might stratify medulloblastoma patients beyond histopathologic staging.",Daniela D;Mauro M;Manuela M;Barbara B;Ketty K;Laura L;Valeria V;Federico F;Raffaella R;Alessandra A;Lucia Sergi LS;Letterio Salvatore LS;Lorenzo L;Alessandro A;Paola P;Ferdinando F;Gian Giacomo GG;Pietro Luigi PL;Rossella R

22624711,Distinct neural stem cell populations give rise to disparate brain tumors in response to N-MYC.,"The proto-oncogene MYCN is mis-expressed in various types of human brain tumors. To clarify how developmental and regional differences influence transformation, we transduced wild-type or mutationally stabilized murine N-myc(T58A) into neural stem cells (NSCs) from perinatal murine cerebellum, brain stem, and forebrain. Transplantation of N-myc(WT) NSCs was insufficient for tumor formation. N-myc(T58A) cerebellar and brain stem NSCs generated medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors, whereas forebrain NSCs developed diffuse glioma. Expression analyses distinguished tumors generated from these different regions, with tumors from embryonic versus postnatal cerebellar NSCs demonstrating Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) dependence and SHH independence, respectively. These differences were regulated in part by the transcription factor SOX9, activated in the SHH subclass of human medulloblastoma. Our results demonstrate context-dependent transformation of NSCs in response to a common oncogenic signal.",Fredrik J FJ;Vasil V;Anders I AI;Justin J;Christopher S CS;Paul A PA;Matthew R MR;Jasmine J;Louis L;Arie A;Joanna J JJ;Michael D MD;William A WA
22622599,Medulloblastoma.,"The mainstay of medulloblastoma treatment is high-quality interdisciplinary collaboration in diagnosis, treatment, and aftercare by all involved disciplines. The first step in treatment of medulloblastoma is a maximal safe surgery, followed by thorough staging. Surgery should only be performed in experienced neurosurgical centers, with age-appropriate postoperative care. As optimal risk stratification is based on histopathological and neuroradiological assessments, these should be performed or confirmed by experienced specialists. Central review of histopathological subtype, as well as review of staging evaluations is highly desirable. For young children with desmoplastic/nodular (DMB), or extensive nodular medulloblastoma, craniospinal or any radiotherapy should be avoided. For young children with classic medulloblastoma (CMB), large cell, or anaplastic medulloblastoma (LC/A MB) optimized strategies with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue with or without local radiotherapy are under investigation. For older clinical standard risk patients (without metastases, without postoperative residual tumor >1.5 cm(2)) with CMB or DMB, craniospinal radiotherapy with 23.4 Gy and boost to the posterior fossa to 54 Gy, followed by maintenance chemotherapy can be regarded as a standard therapy besides other currently applied regimen, such as the use of intensified chemotherapy after irradiation. Older children with LC/A MB, metastatic medulloblastoma, and/or large residual tumor can be regarded as high-risk patients and should receive intensified treatment: intensified chemotherapeutic regimen before or after radiotherapy with increased dose (36-Gy CSI normofractionated, or 40-Gy hyperfractionated) is used. For treatment to be effective, quality control of radiotherapy is of high relevance. Information on long-term sequelae is essential and appropriate multidisciplinary follow-up and support, including rehabilitation and help for reintegration, is necessary. Whenever possible, patients should be included in prospective studies, and tumor material should be sampled to facilitate further research on medulloblastoma biology, which will significantly influence the stratification criteria and the introduction of targeted therapies in standard treatment recommendations in the future.",Katja K;Stefan S
22620685,Cauda equina syndrome as the initial presenting clinical feature of medulloblastoma: a case report.,"Medulloblastoma is one of the most common pediatric brain malignancies. The usual presenting clinical features are related to posterior fossa syndrome or/and hydrocephalus. Cauda equina syndrome is a very rare presentation for this disease. We describe the case of a three-year-old boy with cauda equina syndrome as the initial presenting clinical feature for medulloblastoma. He was initially diagnosed as having a spinal tumor by magnetic resonance imaging scan. Subsequently, a cranial magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a posterior fossa tumor with features of dissemination. He had substantial improvement after treatment. This case report is complemented by a literature review related to this unusual presentation. Medulloblastoma primarily presenting with cauda equina syndrome is very rare. However, spinal drop metastasis should be considered in the pediatric age group to avoid suboptimal management.",Faisal F;Anwar A;Hindi H;Amani A;Essam E
22615000,Medulloblastoma with focal divergent/teratoid differentiation.,"Medulloblastomas with myogenic differentiation, previously termed medullomyoblastomas, form rare variants of medulloblastomas. Occasional tumors showing combined myogenic differentiation and melanotic tubular structures have also been described. On studying the records of a tertiary-care super specialty hospital, of 80 cases of medulloblastoma in a 5-year period, 36 showed nodular islands of neuronal, three myogenic, two glial, and one melanotic differentiation. Of the three cases of medulloblastomas with myogenic differentiation, we came across an extremely rare variant of medulloblastoma showing, in addition to the predominant primitive neuroectodermal component, a single minute nodular focus of 0.8 cm diameter, with divergent differentiation into mainly myogenic, epithelial, cartilaginous, and osseous lineages. Two ependymoblastic rosettes were also identified at different foci. In conclusion, a medulloblastoma with a small nodular island of divergent differentiation into various lineages has been seldom documented in literature. Microscopic foci of multilineage differentiation may be explained by the teratoid potential of medulloblastoma, or pluripotent nature of the neural crest cells, and requires extensive sampling for detection. It remains to be confirmed through more reports whether medulloblastomas with differentiation respond to a treatment protocol similar to that of medulloblastomas.",Kaushik K;Ila I;Ravindra K RK;Puja P;Ajay A
22611031,Estimated clinical benefit of protecting neurogenesis in the developing brain during radiation therapy for pediatric medulloblastoma.,"We sought to assess the feasibility and estimate the benefit of sparing the neurogenic niches when irradiating the brain of pediatric patients with medulloblastoma (MB) based on clinical outcome data. Pediatric MB survivors experience a high risk of neurocognitive adverse effects, often attributed to the whole-brain irradiation that is part of standard management. Neurogenesis is very sensitive to radiation, and limiting the radiation dose to the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) may preserve neurocognitive function. Radiotherapy plans were created using 4 techniques: standard opposing fields, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), intensity-modulated arc therapy (IMAT), and intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). Mean dose to the hippocampus and SVZ (mean for both sites) could be limited to 88.3% (range, 83.6%-91.0%), 77.1% (range, 71.5%-81.3%), and 42.3% (range, 26.6%-51.2%) with IMAT, IMRT, and IMPT, respectively, while maintaining at least 95% of the prescribed dose in 95% of the whole-brain target volume. Estimated risks for developing memory impairment after a prescribed dose of 23.4 Gy were 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21%-69%), 44% (95% CI, 21%-65%), 41% (95% CI, 22%-60%), and 33% (95% CI, 23%-44%) with opposing fields, IMAT, IMRT, and IMPT, respectively. Neurogenic niche sparing during cranial irradiation of pediatric patients with MB is feasible and is estimated to lower the risks of long-term neurocognitive sequelae. Greatest sparing is achieved with intensity-modulated proton therapy, thus making this an attractive option to be tested in a prospective clinical trial.",Malin M;N Patrik NP;Per P;Ivan R IR;Gaspar G;Anne A;Klas K;Birgitta B;Søren M SM;Thomas T

22593583,Carbon monoxide mediates the anti-apoptotic effects of heme oxygenase-1 in medulloblastoma DAOY cells via K+ channel inhibition.,"Tumor cell survival and proliferation is attributable in part to suppression of apoptotic pathways, yet the mechanisms by which cancer cells resist apoptosis are not fully understood. Many cancer cells constitutively express heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which catabolizes heme to generate biliverdin, Fe(2+), and carbon monoxide (CO). These breakdown products may play a role in the ability of cancer cells to suppress apoptotic signals. K(+) channels also play a crucial role in apoptosis, permitting K(+) efflux which is required to initiate caspase activation. Here, we demonstrate that HO-1 is constitutively expressed in human medulloblastoma tissue, and can be induced in the medulloblastoma cell line DAOY either chemically or by hypoxia. Induction of HO-1 markedly increases the resistance of DAOY cells to oxidant-induced apoptosis. This effect was mimicked by exogenous application of the heme degradation product CO. Furthermore we demonstrate the presence of the pro-apoptotic K(+) channel, Kv2.1, in both human medulloblastoma tissue and DAOY cells. CO inhibited the voltage-gated K(+) currents in DAOY cells, and largely reversed the oxidant-induced increase in K(+) channel activity. p38 MAPK inhibition prevented the oxidant-induced increase of K(+) channel activity in DAOY cells, and enhanced their resistance to apoptosis. Our findings suggest that CO-mediated inhibition of K(+) channels represents an important mechanism by which HO-1 can increase the resistance to apoptosis of medulloblastoma cells, and support the idea that HO-1 inhibition may enhance the effectiveness of current chemo- and radiotherapies.",Moza M A MM;Jason L JL;Mark L ML;Hannah E HE;Philip P;Aruna A;John P JP;Chris C
22591662,Pharmacological activation of the p53 pathway by nutlin-3 exerts anti-tumoral effects in medulloblastomas.,"Medulloblastomas account for 20% of pediatric brain tumors. With an overall survival of 40%-70%, their treatment is still a challenge. The majority of medulloblastomas lack p53 mutations, but even in cancers retaining wild-type p53, the tumor surveillance function of p53 is inhibited by the oncoprotein MDM2. Deregulation of the MDM2/p53 balance leads to malignant transformation. Here, we analyzed MDM2 mRNA and protein expression in primary medulloblastomas and normal cerebellum and assessed the mutational status of p53 and MDM2 expression in 6 medulloblastoma cell lines. MDM2 expression was elevated in medulloblastomas, compared with cerebellum. Four of 6 medulloblastoma cell lines expressed wild-type p53 and high levels of MDM2. The tumor-promoting p53-MDM2 interaction can be inhibited by the small molecule, nutlin-3, restoring p53 function. Targeting the p53-MDM2 axis using nutlin-3 significantly reduced cell viability and induced either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis and expression of the p53 target gene p21 in these 4 cell lines. In contrast, DAOY and UW-228 cells harboring TP53 mutations were almost unaffected by nutlin-3 treatment. MDM2 knockdown in medulloblastoma cells by siRNA mimicked nutlin-3 treatment, whereas expression of dominant negative p53 abrogated nutlin-3 effects. Oral nutlin-3 treatment of mice with established medulloblastoma xenografts inhibited tumor growth and significantly increased survival. Thus, nutlin-3 reduced medulloblastoma cell viability in vitro and in vivo by re-activating p53 function. We suggest that inhibition of the MDM2-p53 interaction with nutlin-3 is a promising therapeutic option for medulloblastomas with functional p53 that should be further evaluated in clinical trials.",Annette A;Katleen K;Lukas L;Theresa T;Kristian W KW;Wolfgang W;Michel M;Michael A MA;Hedwig E HE;Frank F;Alexander A;Angelika A;Johannes H JH
22588899,"CIC and FUBP1 mutations in oligodendrogliomas, oligoastrocytomas and astrocytomas.","CIC and FUBP1 mutations have recently been detected in oligodendrogliomas but not in oligoastrocytomas. However, allelic losses in the regions on chromosomal arms 19q and 1p harboring CIC and FUBP1 are a common feature of both, oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas. To resolve this discrepancy, we analyzed CIC and FUBP1 mutations in a set of primary brain tumors including 18 oligodendrogliomas and 42 oligoastrocytomas. In addition, we analyzed 10 astrocytomas and 16 glioblastomas with allelic losses on 19q as well as a set of 12 medulloblastomas for CIC mutations. CIC mutations were found in 15/18 oligodendrogliomas, 14/42 oligoastrocytomas and 3/10 preselected astrocytomas. With the exception of a single case, all CIC mutations occurred in tumors with combined 1p/19q losses. In contrast to oligodendrogliomas where CIC mutations were always detected along with 1p/19q co-deletion, CIC mutations were only found in 52 % of the 1p/19q co-deleted oligoastrocytomas. FUBP1 mutations were detected in 7/61 tumors, all presenting with CIC mutations. FUBP1 mutations appear to cluster in the DNA binding domain spanning exons 5-14. CIC and FUBP1 mutations exclusively occurred in presence of either IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. Our data confirm CIC and FUBP1 mutations in oligodendrogliomas and demonstrate the presence of these mutations in oligoastrocytomas.",Felix F;Christian C;Jochen J;Stefan S;Kerstin K;Wolf W;Christel C;Andreas A;Christian C
22582395,Regulatory factor X1-induced down-regulation of transforming growth factor β2 transcription in human neuroblastoma cells.,"Regulatory factor X (RFX) proteins are transcription factors. Seven mammalian RFX proteins have been identified. RFX1 is the prototype RFX. However, its biological functions are not known. Here, RFX1 overexpression reduced fetal bovine serum-stimulated proliferation of SH-SY5Y cells, a human neuroblastoma cell line. This inhibition is associated with decreased transforming growth factor β2 (TGFβ2) and phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Exogenous TGFβ2 increased cell proliferation and phospho-ERK in cells overexpressing RFX1. An anti-TGFβ2 antibody and PD98059, an ERK activation inhibitor, inhibited SH-SY5Y cell proliferation. TGFβ2 promoter activity was decreased in cells overexpressing RFX1. Chromosome immunoprecipitation assay showed that RFX1 bound the TGFβ2 promoter. RFX1 down-regulation increased TGFβ2 in SH-SY5Y and HCN-1A cells, a normal human neuronal cell line. More importantly, TGFβ2 concentrations were negatively correlated with RFX1 levels in human medulloblastoma tissues with a R(2) of 0.464. These results suggest that RFX1 reduces cell proliferation through inhibiting the TGFβ2-ERK signaling pathway. RFX1 blocks TGFβ2 expression through its direct action on TGFβ2 transcription. This effect also appears in human brain tumor tissues. Because TGFβ is known to be involved in cancer development, our results provide initial evidence to suggest that RFX1 may play an important role in human tumor biology.",Chenzhuo C;Zhiyi Z
22574128,GFAP-Cre-mediated transgenic activation of Bmi1 results in pituitary tumors.,"Bmi1 is a member of the polycomb repressive complex 1 and plays different roles during embryonic development, depending on the developmental context. Bmi1 over expression is observed in many types of cancer, including tumors of astroglial and neural origin. Although genetic depletion of Bmi1 has been described to result in tumor inhibitory effects partly through INK4A/Arf mediated senescence and apoptosis and also through INK4A/Arf independent effects, it has not been proven that Bmi1 can be causally involved in the formation of these tumors. To see whether this is the case, we developed two conditional Bmi1 transgenic models that were crossed with GFAP-Cre mice to activate transgenic expression in neural and glial lineages. We show here that these mice generate intermediate and anterior lobe pituitary tumors that are positive for ACTH and beta-endorphin. Combined transgenic expression of Bmi1 together with conditional loss of Rb resulted in pituitary tumors but was insufficient to induce medulloblastoma therefore indicating that the oncogenic function of Bmi1 depends on regulation of p16(INK4A)/Rb rather than on regulation of p19(ARF)/p53. Human pituitary adenomas show Bmi1 overexpression in over 50% of the cases, which indicates that Bmi1 could be causally involved in formation of these tumors similarly as in our mouse model.",Bart A BA;Marleen M;Ellen E;Martin M;Ji-Ying JY;Marije M;Jules J;Paulien P;John J;Haydn M HM;Anthony A;Eleonora E;Maarten M
22573308,Early recurrence in standard-risk medulloblastoma patients with the common idic(17)(p11.2) rearrangement.,"Medulloblastoma is diagnosed histologically; treatment depends on staging and age of onset. Whereas clinical factors identify a standard- and a high-risk population, these findings cannot differentiate which standard-risk patients will relapse and die. Outcome is thought to be influenced by tumor subtype and molecular alterations. Poor prognosis has been associated with isochromosome (i)17q in some but not all studies. In most instances, molecular investigations document that i17q is not a true isochromosome but rather an isodicentric chromosome, idic(17)(p11.2), with rearrangement breakpoints mapping within the REPA/REPB region on 17p11.2. This study explores the clinical utility of testing for idic(17)(p11.2) rearrangements using an assay based on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). This test was applied to 58 consecutive standard- and high-risk medulloblastomas with a 5-year minimum of clinical follow-up. The presence of i17q (ie, including cases not involving the common breakpoint), idic(17)(p11.2), and histologic subtype was correlated with clinical outcome. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were consistent with literature reports. Fourteen patients (25%) had i17q, with 10 (18%) involving the common isodicentric rearrangement. The presence of i17q was associated with a poor prognosis. OS and DFS were poor in all cases with anaplasia (4), unresectable disease (7), and metastases at presentation (10); however, patients with standard-risk tumors fared better. Of these 44 cases, tumors with idic(17)(p11.2) were associated with significantly worse patient outcomes and shorter mean DFS. FISH detection of idic(17)(p11.2) may be useful for risk stratification in standard-risk patients. The presence of this abnormal chromosome is associated with early recurrence of medulloblastoma.",Gabriel A GA;Dolores D;Meena B MB;Kayuri U KU;Pawel P;James R JR;John D JD;Arie A
22569584,Spontaneous cerebellar primitive neuroectodermal tumor in a juvenile cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis).,"A neoplastic mass compressing the left cerebellar hemisphere and hindbrain was observed at trimming in a 3&frac12;-year-old male cynomolgus monkey from a control dose group. Microscopically, the neoplastic mass was nonencapsulated, invasive, and showed two morphological patterns. The predominant area consisted of densely packed undifferentiated, polygonal to spindle cells arranged in vague sheets supported by a scant fibrovascular stroma. The other area was less cellular and composed of round neoplastic cells separated by eosinophilic fibrillar material. Immunohistochemical staining for vimentin, synaptophysin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neuron-specific enolase, neurofilament, and S-100 confirmed the presence of primitive undifferentiated neuroectodermal cells and some cells with neuronal or glial differentiation. On the basis of histopathology and immunohistochemical findings, a diagnosis of cerebellar primitive neuroectodermal tumor with neuronal and glial differentiation was made. Primitive neuroectodermal tumors are rare in animals including nonhuman primates; this is the first published report in this species.",Sydney S;Petrina P;Ana L AL;Stuart W SW;Alys A
22569092,Ubiquitination and deubiquitination of REST and its roles in cancers.,"REST/NRSF (the RE-1 silencing transcription factor or neuron-restrictive silencer factor) was originally identified as a transcriptional repressor of a number of neuronal-specific genes in neural stem cells and non-neuronal cells. REST functions as a master regulator in the maintenance of neural stem cells. During tumorigenesis, REST shows opposing roles in different type of cells. In human epithelial cancers such as colon cancer, REST acts as a tumor suppressor. In contrast, REST plays an oncogenic role in the development of brain tumors and other cancers. Abnormal upregulation of REST has been found in medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma and glioblastoma (GBM). Recent studies in GBMs suggest that REST exerts its oncogenic function by maintaining self-renewal potential of glioma stem cells (GSCs).",Zhi Z;Shideng S
22565209,The clinical implications of medulloblastoma subgroups.,"Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour, is currently diagnosed and stratified using a combination of clinical and demographic variables. Recent transcriptomic approaches have demonstrated that the histological entity known as medulloblastoma is comprised of multiple clinically and molecularly distinct subgroups. The current consensus is that four defined subgroups of medulloblastoma exist: WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4. Each subgroup probably contains at least one additional level of hierarchy, with some evidence for multiple subtypes within each subgroup. The demographic and clinical differences between the subgroups present immediate and pressing questions to be addressed in the next round of clinical trials for patients with medulloblastoma. Many of the genetically defined targets for rational medulloblastoma therapies are unique to a given subgroup, suggesting the need for subgroup-specific trials of novel therapies. The development of practical, robust and widely accepted subgroup biomarkers that are amenable to the conditions of a prospective clinical trial is, therefore, an urgent need for the paediatric neuro-oncology community. In this Review, we discuss the clinical implications of molecular subgrouping in medulloblastoma, highlighting how these subgroups are transitioning from a research topic in the laboratory to a clinically relevant topic with important implications for patient care.",Paul A PA;Andrey A;Stefan M SM;Michael D MD
22565004,Prospective study of health-related quality of life for children with brain tumors treated with proton radiotherapy.,"We describe the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of a cohort of children with brain tumors treated with proton radiotherapy. We recruited 142 pediatric patients with brain tumors (age 2 to 18 years) and parents of such patients treated with proton radiation at Massachusetts General Hospital from 2004 to 2010. HRQoL was assessed using the PedsQL core, brain tumor, and cancer modules (range, 0 to 100). Assessments took place during radiation and annually thereafter. We examined correlations of HRQoL with disease, treatment, and cognitive and behavioral data. Overall reports of HRQoL during treatment were 74.8 and 78.1 for child self-report (CSR) and 67.0 and 74.8 for parent proxy report (PPR) for the core and brain tumor modules, respectively. PPR demonstrated lower HRQoL scores than CSR, but the two were highly correlated. Higher HRQoL scores were significantly associated with Wechsler Full Scale Intelligence Quotient scores (administered via the age-appropriate version) and better scores on two behavioral measures. Disease type also correlated with PPR core total HRQoL score at the beginning of treatment: medulloblastoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 57.8; germ cell tumors, 63.5; ependymoma or high-grade glioma, 69.8; low-grade glioma, 71.5; and other low-grade neoplasms, 78.0 (P = .001). Craniospinal irradiation and chemotherapy were negatively correlated with HRQoL. This is the first study to our knowledge of HRQoL in a cohort of children with brain tumors treated with proton radiation. This prospective study demonstrates the effect of disease type and intensity of treatment on HRQoL. It further suggests that where CSR is not possible, PPR is appropriate in most circumstances.",Karen A KA;Margaret B MB;Beow Y BY;Dianali D;Jennifer J;Kristen S KS;David D;Annah N AN;Shannon M SM;Nancy J NJ;Torunn I TI
22560511,Developmental origins of brain tumors.,"Brain tumors are devastating owing to the high fatality rate and the devastating impact on life qualities of patients. Recent advancement of comparative transcriptome profiling tools and mouse genetic models has greatly deepened our understanding of the developmental origins of these tumors, which could lead to effective therapeutic strategies. We review recent progresses in three types of brain tumors: ependymoma, medulloblastoma, and malignant glioma. The conceptual framework established by these studies converged on three important aspects. First, subtypes in each tumor group originate from distinct cell types. Second, each cell-of-origin is uniquely susceptible to some but not other genetic mutations. Lastly, mutant stem cells may not transform until they differentiate into more restricted progenitor cell type. Overall, these findings indicate the existence of intricate interactions between gene mutations and developmental program for the formation of brain tumors.",Chong C;Hui H
22558385,Aberrant Otx2 expression enhances migration and induces ectopic proliferation of hindbrain neuronal progenitor cells.,"Dysregulation of Otx2 is a hallmark of the pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma, yet its functional significance in the establishment of these tumors is unknown. Here we have sought to determine the functional consequences of Otx2 overexpression in the mouse hindbrain to characterize its potential role in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis and identify the cell types responsive to this lineage-specific oncogene. Expression of Otx2 broadly in the mouse hindbrain resulted in the accumulation of proliferative clusters of cells in the cerebellar white matter and dorsal brainstem of postnatal mice. We found that brainstem ectopia were derived from neuronal progenitors of the rhombic lip and that cerebellar ectopia were derived from granule neuron precursors (GNPs) that had migrated inwards from the external granule layer (EGL). These hyperplasias exhibited various characteristics of medulloblastoma precursor cells identified in animal models of Shh or Wnt group tumors, including aberrant localization and altered spatiotemporal control of proliferation. However, ectopia induced by Otx2 differentiated and dispersed as the animals reached adulthood, indicating that factors restricting proliferative lifespan were a limiting factor to full transformation of these cells. These studies implicate a role for Otx2 in altering the dynamics of neuronal progenitor cell proliferation.",Matthew M;Genglin G;Julia Lailai JL;Darell D DD;Yiping Y;Hai H
22555093,Use of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue as a DNA source in molecular epidemiological studies of pediatric CNS tumors.,"Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPET) samples are a potential source of DNA for molecular epidemiological studies. However, the use of FFPET samples can be restricted by the yield and quality of DNA isolated. The aim of this study was to examine whether FFPET biopsies from pediatric central nervous system tumors were a feasible alternative to archival frozen tissue when characterizing common gene polymorphisms. DNA was isolated from 50 frozen pediatric central nervous system tumor biopsies and matched FFPET samples. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to quantify DNA and characterize GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1, and MTHFR gene polymorphisms. The use of whole-genome amplification (WGA) to increase DNA yields was also investigated. The results showed that DNA isolated from FFPET samples was more fragmented and provided smaller yields than DNA isolated from frozen samples. Attempts to increase the DNA yield from FFPET using WGA were unsuccessful. DNA from FFPET samples was successfully genotyped for the GSTP1 Ile105Val and MTHFR 677 C>T polymorphisms in 98% of samples and was 100% concordant with the results from frozen tissue. However, DNA from FFPET performed poorly in real-time PCR assays for GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletion polymorphisms. Our investigations show that DNA extracted from FFPET is substantially fragmented and not readily amplified using WGA. In addition, careful validation of PCR assays should be carried out due to the variable amplification of fragmented FFPET DNA.",Anthea Elizabeth AE;Richard Julian RJ;Lesley Jayne LJ
22553304,Dilemmas concerning dose distribution and the influence of relative biological effect in proton beam therapy of medulloblastoma.,"To improve medulloblastoma proton therapy. Although considered ideal for proton therapy, there are potential disadvantages. Expected benefits include reduced radiation-induced cancer and circulatory complications, while avoiding small brain volumes of dose in-homogeneity when compared with conventional X-rays. Several aspects of proton therapy might contribute to reduced tumour control due to (a) the use of more homogenous dose levels which can result in under-dosage, (b) differences in relative biological effectiveness (RBE) between that prescription RBE of 1.1 and the RBE of brain and spinal cord (likely to exceed 1.1) and in medulloblastoma cells (where RBE is likely to be below 1.1). Such changes, although speculative for RBE, might result in potential underdosage of tumour cells and a higher bio-effect in brain tissue. Dose distributions for X-ray and proton treatment are compared, with allocation of likely RBE values for fast growing medullolastoma cells and stable central nervous system tissue. These physical and radiobiological factors are shown to combine to give a higher risk of tumour recurrence with further risks on tumour control when dose reduction schedules used for X-ray therapy are replicated for proton therapy for ""low-risk"" patients. The dose distributions and prescribed doses of proton therapy, taking into account RBE, in children and adults with medulloblastoma, need to be reconsidered.",B B;P P;A A;J J;G G
22552444,PAX2 is an antiapoptotic molecule with deregulated expression in medulloblastoma.,"PAX2 is a paired box transcription factor possessing a fundamental role in the embryogenesis of hindbrain and urinary tract. PAX genes are proto-oncogenes, PAX2 expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma. Because of the expression of PAX2 in the developing hindbrain and its essential role in cerebellar development, it has been hypothesized that PAX2 may also be involved in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis. We investigated the expression pattern of PAX2 and various genes of the neuronal lineage in medulloblastoma and glioma cell lines. We found high expression of PAX2 mRNA and PAX2 protein in medulloblastoma cells and some glioma cell lines independent of their neuronal lineage gene expression signature. Gene suppression of PAX2 decreased the expression of the PAX2 transcriptional target GDNF in Daoy cells and had a profound cytotoxic effect in vitro on Daoy medulloblastoma and T98G glioma cells. Expression of PAX2 was then assessed in two separate medulloblastoma tissue microarrays with a total of 61 patient samples by immunohistochemistry. PAX2 expression was detected in the majority of medulloblastoma samples and correlated with less differentiated histology. Therefore, PAX2 is a biomarker for a more aggressive medulloblastoma phenotype and may represent a novel therapeutic target.",M C MC;D P DP;P P;M W MW;C C;M M;M R MR;T T;M M;J J;M M;J P JP
22551695,Paroxysmal alternating nystagmus.,"Paroxysmal reversal of spontaneous nystagmus has rarely been described. Herein, we report recurrent bouts of vertigo and oscillopsia in association with reversed spontaneous nystagmus in a patient with prior surgical resection of the cerebellar vermis due to medulloblastoma and subsequent labyrinthine damage. The symptoms almost completely resolved with carbamazepine. The episodes may be ascribed to paroxysmal reversal of the vestibular asymmetry due to intermittent decompensation by the deficient cerebellum.",Seong-Joon SJ;Sung-Yeon SY;Ji Soo JS;So Young SY
22550175,Hedgehog pathway inhibitor saridegib (IPI-926) increases lifespan in a mouse medulloblastoma model.,"The Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway drives a subset of medulloblastomas, a malignant neuroectodermal brain cancer, and other cancers. Small-molecule Shh pathway inhibitors have induced tumor regression in mice and patients with medulloblastoma; however, drug resistance rapidly emerges, in some cases via de novo mutation of the drug target. Here we assess the response and resistance mechanisms to the natural product derivative saridegib in an aggressive Shh-driven mouse medulloblastoma model. In this model, saridegib treatment induced tumor reduction and significantly prolonged survival. Furthermore, the effect of saridegib on tumor-initiating capacity was demonstrated by reduced tumor incidence, slower growth, and spontaneous tumor regression that occurred in allografts generated from previously treated autochthonous medulloblastomas compared with those from untreated donors. Saridegib, a known P-glycoprotein (Pgp) substrate, induced Pgp activity in treated tumors, which likely contributed to emergence of drug resistance. Unlike other Smoothened (Smo) inhibitors, the drug resistance was neither mutation-dependent nor Gli2 amplification-dependent, and saridegib was found to be active in cells with the D473H point mutation that rendered them resistant to another Smo inhibitor, GDC-0449. The fivefold increase in lifespan in mice treated with saridegib as a single agent compares favorably with both targeted and cytotoxic therapies. The absence of genetic mutations that confer resistance distinguishes saridegib from other Smo inhibitors.",Michelle J MJ;Beryl A BA;Elisabeth H EH;Paritosh C PC;Seth D SD;Sally S;Barbara B;Keith K;Kerry F KF;Chris C;Michael M;Julie J;Sue E SE;Stacey S;Andrew A;Brandon J BJ;Karen K;James M JM
22550044,Recurrent anaplastic medulloblastoma in cerebrospinal fluid after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dissemination can be seen relatively frequently in medulloblastomas and its presence at diagnosis is important for determining both treatment and prognosis. The anaplastic variant is an aggressive variant of medulloblastoma with characteristic histopathologic features and unfavorable prognosis that was included in the latest WHO classification. Herein, we report the CSF cytologic features of a case of recurrent anaplastic medulloblastoma in a 17-year-old male patient who had undergone autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant as a part of the treatment protocol. The malignant cells were large, had high nucleocytoplasmic ratios, and highly pleomorphic, frequently polylobated nuclei with coarse chromatin and 1-3 visible nucleoli. These CSF cytologic features differed significantly from those of classic medulloblastoma, which usually shows small cells with rounded, rather uniform nuclei with fine (""blastic"") chromatin. The differential diagnosis of anaplastic medulloblastoma is broader than that of classic medulloblastoma, as it includes metastatic carcinomas and large cell lymphoma, a differential diagnosis especially pertinent in this patient with a history of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Awareness of these unusual but distinctive cytologic features is important for the accurate diagnosis of anaplastic medulloblastomas in CSF specimens and to avoid possible diagnostic pitfalls.",Andrew C AC;Charanjeet C;H H;Stefan E SE
22544282,"Integrating role of T antigen, Rb2/p130, CTCF and BORIS in mediating non-canonical endoplasmic reticulum-dependent death pathways triggered by chronic ER stress in mouse medulloblastoma.","Distinct molecular pathways could be constitutively active in mouse T-Antigen positive and T-Antigen negative medulloblastoma cell lines, contributing to their phenotypic differences as well as to cellular responses, cell cycle progression, cell death and survival. The diversity of these responses may be due, at least in part, to distinct activities of Rb2/p130, CTCF and BORIS proteins in response to an altered network of signaling evoked by the T-Ag presence. Here, we provided evidence supporting a role for the T-Antigen in causing chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and aberrant Caspase-12 expression and activation, subsequently driving to both massive cell death, and perhaps selection of cells with a higher malignant phenotype. Furthermore, we observed that the endoplasmic stress, either chronically caused by T-Ag or transiently induced by glucose deprivation, is accompanied by the formation of complexes between the retinoblastoma related protein Rb2/p130 and the chromatin insulator CCCTC-binding factor CTCF, or the CTCF-paralogue BORIS. Our study represents the first evidence supporting a role of the T-Antigen in inducing/maintaining chronic ER-stress, as well as, indicating a role of Rb2/p130, CTCF and BORIS as potential mediators of non-canonical ER-dependent death pathway in mouse medulloblastoma.",Marcella M;Valentina V;Valeria V;Ang A;Micaela M;Giuseppe G;Gianfranco G;Kamel K;Antonio A
22542805,Blockade of SOX4 mediated DNA repair by SPARC enhances radioresponse in medulloblastoma.,"SPARC is a matricellular glycoprotein and a putative radioresistance-reversal-gene. We therefore explored the possibility of SPARC expression on medulloblastoma radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo. The combined treatment of the SPARC and irradiation resulted in increased cell death when compared to cells treated with irradiation alone in vitro and in vivo. SPARC expression prior to irradiation suppressed checkpoints-1,-2 and p53 phosphorylation and DNA repair gene XRCC1. We also demonstrate that SPARC expression suppressed irradiation induced SOX-4 mediated DNA repair. These results provide evidence of the anti-tumor effect of combining SPARC with irradiation as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of medulloblastoma.",Chandramu C;Ranadheer R;Meena M;Dzung H DH;Sajani S SS
22540632,Distinct sulfonation activities in resveratrol-sensitive and resveratrol-insensitive human glioblastoma cells.,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells show different responses to resveratrol, for unknown reasons. Our data from human medulloblastoma cells and primary cultures of rat brain cells revealed an inverse correlation of sulfonation activity with resveratrol sensitivities, providing a clue to the underlying mechanisms of the variable sensitivities of GBM cells to resveratrol. In this study, we found that U251 cells were sensitive and LN229 cells were insensitive to resveratrol. Thus, these two cell lines were taken as comparable models for elucidating the influence of sulfonation activities on resveratrol sensitivity. HPLC showed identical resveratrol metabolic patterns in both cell lines. LC/MS and high-resolution mass MS analyses further demonstrated that resveratrol monosulfate generated by sulfotransferases (SULTs) was the major metabolite of human GBM cells. The levels of brain-associated SULT (SULT1A1, SULT1C2, and SULT4A1) expression in U251 cells were lower than those in LN229 cells, suggesting the inverse relationship of SULT-mediated sulfonation activity with high intracellular resveratrol bioavailability and resveratrol sensitivity of human GBM cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining revealed reductions in expression of the three brain-associated SULTs in 72.8%, 47.5% and 66.3% of astrocytomas, respectively. Therefore, the levels of brain-associated SULTs and sulfonation activity mediated by them could be important parameters for evaluating the potential response of human GBM cells to resveratrol, and may have value in the personalized treatment of GBMs with resveratrol.",Zheng Z;Hong H;Xiao-Hong XH;Hui H;Xiao-Yan XY;Qing-You QY;Mo-Li ML;Jia J
22539980,Widespread contribution of Gdf7 lineage to cerebellar cell types and implications for hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma formation.,"The roof plate is a specialized embryonic midline tissue of the central nervous system that functions as a signaling center regulating dorsal neural patterning. In the developing hindbrain, roof plate cells express Gdf7 and previous genetic fate mapping studies showed that these cells contribute mostly to non-neural choroid plexus epithelium. We demonstrate here that constitutive activation of the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway in the Gdf7 lineage invariably leads to medulloblastoma. Lineage tracing analysis reveals that Gdf7-lineage cells not only are a source of choroid plexus epithelial cells, but are also present in the cerebellar rhombic lip and contribute to a subset of cerebellar granule neuron precursors, the presumed cell-of-origin for Sonic hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma. We further show that Gdf7-lineage cells also contribute to multiple neuronal and glial cell types in the cerebellum, including glutamatergic granule neurons, unipolar brush cells, Purkinje neurons, GABAergic interneurons, Bergmann glial cells, and white matter astrocytes. These findings establish hindbrain roof plate as a novel source of diverse neural cell types in the cerebellum that is also susceptible to oncogenic transformation by deregulated Sonic hedgehog signaling.",Frances Y FY;Xi X;Anuraag A;Tatiana T;Michael K MK;Ying Y;Chin C
22537175,Expression patterns and potential roles of SIRT1 in human medulloblastoma cells in vivo and in vitro.,"Medulloblastoma is a primitive neuroectodermal tumor, which originates in the cerebellum, presumably due to the alterations of some neurogenetic elements. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a class III histone deacetylase (HDAC), regulates differentiation of neuronal stem cells but its status in medulloblastomas remains largely unknown. The current study aimed to address this issue by checking SIRT1 expression in noncancerous cerebellar tissues, medulloblastoma tissues and established cell lines. The roles of SIRT1 in proliferation and survival of UW228-3 medulloblastoma cells were analyzed by SIRT1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection and SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide treatment. The results revealed that the frequency of SIRT1 expression in medulloblastoma tissues was 64.17% (77/120), while only one out of seven tumor-surrounding noncancerous cerebellar tissues showed restricted SIRT1 expression in the cells within the granule layer. Of the three morphological subtypes, the rates of SIRT1 detection in the large cell/anaplastic cell (79.07%; 34/43) and the classic medulloblastomas (60.29%; 41/68) are higher than that (22.22%; 2/9) in nodular/desmoplastic medulloblastomas (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively). Heterogeneous SIRT1 expression was commonly observed in classic medulloblastoma. Inhibition of SIRT1 expression by siRNA arrested 64.96% of UW228-3 medulloblastoma cells in the gap 1 (G1) phase and induced 14.53% of cells to apoptosis at the 48-h time point. Similarly, inhibition of SIRT1 enzymatic activity with nicotinamide brought about G1 arrest and apoptosis in a dose-related fashion. Our data thus indicate: (i) that SIRT1 may act as a G1-phase promoter and a survival factor in medulloblastoma cells; and (ii) that SIRT1 expression is correlated with the formation and prognosis of human medulloblastomas. In this context, SIRT1 would be a potential therapeutic target of medulloblastomas.",Jing-Xin JX;Hong H;Xiao-Ming XM;Xiang-Hong XH;Qian Q;Mo-Li ML;Qing-You QY;Zai-Xia ZX;Jia J
25722678,Gene expression by simian virus 40 large T antigen-induced medulloblastomas in mice.,"Signaling pathways known to have components with mutations in human medulloblastoma include sonic hedgehog, Wnt/beta-catenin and insulin-like growth factor. Microarray analysis was applied to examine the gene expression changes in medulloblastomas of pTet-on/pTRE-SV40Tag transgenic mice. Altogether, 14 112 genes were detectable, including 152 genes with significantly different expression levels. These genes were associated with immunity, the cell cycle, signal transduction, cytoskeleton and metabolism. To further confirm the microarray data, real-time polymerase chain reactions were used to examine the expression changes of genes related to sonic hedgehog, Wnt/beta-catenin and insulin-like growth factor signal pathways. Immunohistochemistry detected insulin receptor substrate-1 in the nuclei of brain tumor tissue cells from pTet-on/pTRE-SV40Tag transgenic mice, suggesting that SV40 large T antigen may activate the insulin-like growth factor signal pathway to promote tumorigenesis.",Xiaoluan X;Jie J;Yinghe Y
22528798,Dual contrast perfusion MRI in a single imaging session for assessment of pediatric brain tumors.,"Ferumoxytol, an iron nanoparticle used as an intravascular contrast agent for perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has never been explored in the pediatric population. The purpose of this prospective study is to characterize the vascular and permeability properties of pediatric brain tumors using two contrast agents during a single imaging session: ferumoxytol for dynamic susceptibility weighted contrast (DSC) MRI and gadoteridol for dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. In a single imaging session, patients received intravenous ferumoxytol for DSC MRI followed by gadoteridol for DCE MRI. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF), transfer coefficient (K(trans)), and extravascular extracellular space volume fraction (v(e)) of the brain lesions were calculated. Patients underwent serial imaging sessions over the course of 2 years. Of the 7 patients enrolled thus far, none has experienced an adverse event. Two patients with medulloblastoma were enrolled preoperatively. In the first, rCBV(max), rCBF, K(trans) max, and v(e) max values were 3.74, 3.12, 0.47 min (-1), and 0.08, respectively, while in the second patient, rCBV(max), rCBF, K(trans) max, and v(e) max values were 4.72, 3.47, 0.60 min(-1), and 0.05, respectively. Four patients were enrolled after new gadolinium enhancement was noted in the tumor resection cavity. In 80 % of these lesions, rCBV was <1 suggestive of pseudoprogression secondary to radiochemotherapy. These preliminary results demonstrate that use of ferumoxytol and gadoteridol contrast agents during a single imaging session is feasible, safe, and appears useful for assessing tumor perfusion and permeability characteristics in children.",Eric M EM;Daniel J DJ;Edit E;Xin X;Kellie J KJ;Seymur S;Bronwyn E BE;Edward A EA
22528793,Rho GTPases in primary brain tumor malignancy and invasion.,"Gliomas are the most common type of malignant primary brain tumor in humans, accounting for 80 % of malignant cases. Expression and activity of Rho GTPases, which coordinate several cellular processes including cell-cycle progression and cell migration, are commonly altered in many types of primary brain tumor. Here we review the suggested effects of deregulated Rho GTPase signaling on brain tumor malignancy, highlighting the controversy in the field. For instance, whereas expression of RhoA and RhoB has been found to be significantly reduced in astrocytic tumors, other studies have reported Rho-dependent LPA-induced migration in glioma cells. Moreover, whereas the Rac1 expression level has been found to be reduced in astrocytic tumor, it was overexpressed and induced invasion in medulloblastoma tumors. In addition to the Rho GTPases themselves, several of their downstream effectors (including ROCK, mDia, and N-WASP) and upstream regulators (including GEFs, GAPs, PI3K, and PTEN) have also been implicated in primary brain tumors.",Bassem D BD;Mirvat M
22517408,Life years lost--comparing potentially fatal late complications after radiotherapy for pediatric medulloblastoma on a common scale.,"The authors developed a framework for estimating and comparing the risks of various long-term complications on a common scale and applied it to 3 different techniques for craniospinal irradiation in patients with pediatric medulloblastoma. Radiation dose-response parameters related to excess hazard ratios for secondary breast, lung, stomach, and thyroid cancer; heart failure, and myocardial infarction were derived from large published clinical series. Combined with age-specific and sex-specific hazards in the US general population, the dose-response analysis yielded excess hazards of complications for a cancer survivor as a function of attained age. After adjusting for competing risks of death, life years lost (LYL) were estimated based on excess hazard and prognosis of a complication for 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D CRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). Lung cancer contributed most to the estimated LYL, followed by myocardial infarction, and stomach cancer. The estimates of breast or thyroid cancer incidence were higher than those for lung and stomach cancer incidence, but LYL were lower because of the relatively good prognosis. Estimated LYL ranged between 1.90 years for 3D CRT to 0.28 years for IMPT. In a paired comparison, IMPT was associated with significantly fewer LYL than both photon techniques. Estimating the risk of late complications is associated with considerable uncertainty, but including prognosis and attained age at an event to obtain the more informative LYL estimate added relatively little to this uncertainty.",N Patrik NP;Ivan R IR;Maja V MV;Per P;Marianne C MC;Anne A;Per P;Thomas T;Lena L;Søren M SM
22513110,Utility of apparent diffusion coefficient ratios in distinguishing common pediatric cerebellar tumors.,"The aim of this study was to identify clinically useful tumor/normal brain apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ratios for distinguishing common pediatric cerebellar tumors. Review of medical records revealed 79 patients with cerebellar tumors who underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, including diffusion-weighted imaging sequences, and surgery. There were 31 pilocytic astrocytomas, 27 medulloblastomas, 14 ependymomas, and seven atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors. ADC values were measured by placing regions of interest on the solid tumor and normal brain parenchyma by two reviewers. Tumor/normal brain ADC ratios were calculated. Mean ADC values of the pilocytic astrocytomas were greater than those of ependymomas, whose mean ADC values were greater than those of medulloblastomas and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors. Using a tumor/normal brain ADC ratio threshold of 1.70 to distinguish pilocytic astrocytomas from ependymomas, sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 79% were achieved. A tumor/normal brain ADC ratio threshold of 1.20 enabled the sorting of ependymomas from medulloblastomas with sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 88%. Tumor/normal brain ADC ratios allow the distinguishing of common pediatric cerebellar tumors.",Barjor B;Kevin K;Betul B;Lynn L;Kadriye M KM;Daniel C DC;Korgun K
22511755,Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR)-mediated regulation of WNT/β-catenin signaling is enhanced in irradiated medulloblastoma cells.,"Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is known to promote invasion, migration, and metastasis in cancer cells. In this report, we showed that ionizing radiation (IR)-induced uPAR has a role in WNT-β-catenin signaling and mediates induction of cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties in medulloblastoma cell lines UW228 and D283. We observed that IR induced the expression of uPAR and CSC markers, such as Musashi-1 and CD44, and activated WNT-7a-β-catenin signaling molecules. Overexpression of uPAR alone or with IR treatment led to increased WNT-7a-β-catenin-TCF/LEF-mediated transactivation, thereby promoting cancer stemness. In contrast, treatment with shRNA specific for uPAR (pU) suppressed WNT-7a-β-catenin-TCF/LEF-mediated transactivation both in vitro and in vivo. Quercetin, a potent WNT/β-catenin inhibitor, suppressed uPAR and uPAR-mediated WNT/β-catenin activation, and furthermore, addition of recombinant human WNT-7a protein induced uPAR, indicating the existence of a mutual regulatory relationship between uPAR and WNT/β-catenin signaling. We showed that uPAR was physically associated with the WNT effector molecule β-catenin on the membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus of IR-treated cells and CSC. Most interestingly, we demonstrated for the first time that localization of uPAR in the nucleus was associated with transcription factors (TF) and their specific response elements. We observed from uPAR-ChIP, TF protein, and protein/DNA array analyses that uPAR associates with activating enhancer-binding protein 2α (AP2a) and mediates β-catenin gene transcription. Moreover, association of uPAR with the β-catenin·TCF/LEF complex and various other TF involved during embryonic development and cancer indicates that uPAR is a potent activator of stemness, and targeting of uPAR in combination with radiation has significant therapeutic implications.",Swapna S;Christopher S CS;Arun Kumar AK;Kiran Kumar KK;Bharathi B;Jasti S JS

To evaluate the contribution of these mutations to the genesis of sporadic medulloblastomas, we screened a series of unselected patients with medulloblastoma for germline SUFU mutations. A complete mutational analysis of the SUFU gene was performed on genomic DNA in all 131 consecutive patients treated for medulloblastoma in the pediatrics department of the Institut Gustave Roussy between 1972 and 2009 and for whom a blood sample was available. We identified eight germline mutations of the SUFU gene: one large genomic duplication and seven point mutations. Mutations were identified in three of three individuals with medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity, four of 20 with desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastomas, and one of 108 with other subtypes. All eight patients were younger than 3 years of age at diagnosis. The mutations were inherited from the healthy father in four of six patient cases in which the parents accepted genetic testing; de novo mutations accounted for the other two patient cases. Associated events were macrocrania in six patients, hypertelorism in three patients, and multiple basal cell carcinomas in the radiation field after age 18 years in one patient. These data indicate that germline SUFU mutations were responsible for a high proportion of desmoplastic medulloblastoma in children younger than 3 years of age. Genetic testing should be offered to all children diagnosed with sonic hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma at a young age.",Laurence L;Audrey A;Gaëlle G;Pascale P;Sébastien S;Véronique V;Johny J;Stéphanie S;Olivier O;Christelle C;Olivier O;Brigitte B;Jacques J
22498198,Medulloblastoma: progress over time.,"Medulloblastoma is the most common central nervous system tumour in children aged 0-4 years, with 75% of cases occurring in patients <16 years, and rare in adults. The intent of this audit is to review a single centre's experience and to compare outcomes with other centres' outcomes. This Ethics approved retrospective audit evaluates the paediatric population aged <16 years who received radiotherapy as their initial or salvage treatment at the Prince of Wales Hospital Cancer Centre between 1972 and 2007. The primary and secondary end-points were progression-free survival (PFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS), with comparisons made between patients treated before and after 1990, and the impact of high- and low-risk disease. There were 80 eligible patients, 78 who had radiotherapy at initial presentation, and 2 at the time of recurrence. Median age was 6.5 years, 52 were boys and 28 were girls. Seventy-eight patients had a surgical procedure and ultimately received craniospinal radiotherapy. Of these 78 patients, 32 (40%) had a macroscopically complete resection. The 5-year PFS was 69.7%. The 5-year PFS for patients treated pre and post 1990 was 66.1% and 71.8%, respectively. The 5-year CSS for high- and low-risk patients was 61.1% and 78.4%, respectively. Ultimately, 33% of patients were dead due to disease. This audit demonstrates those children referred to this facility for treatment have comparable survival to that of other major centres.",Robert I RI;Janet R JR;Katie J KJ;Nicola S NS;Richard R
22497851,Infant brain tumors: a neuropathologic population-based institutional reappraisal.,"The factors that impact the long-term functional outcome for infants with brain tumor are unclear. The clinicopathologic features of all infant brain tumors occurring at our institution (1982-2005) were reexamined to explore the factors influencing prognosis. The details of the neuropathologic review are reported herein. Thirty-five cases were identified and included 7 astrocytomas (6 low grade and 1 glioblastoma), 6 atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors, 5 choroid plexus papillomas, 4 ependymomas (3 anaplastic), 4 teratomas (3 immature), 2 supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 2 gangliogliomas, 2 desmoplastic tumors of infancy, and 1 each of ""medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity,"" adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma, and 1 ""malignancy not otherwise specified."" The original diagnosis was changed in 8 cases (23%), and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors was the most common revision (n = 5). Case 9 was unusual in that both the patient and her 2-year-old sister displayed INI-1 immunonegative posterior fossa tumors and extended survival. Tumor grade was altered in 6 cases (17%), the most significant instance being the downgrading from the World Health Organization grade IV to I (case 18: supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors to desmoplastic tumors of infancy). As opposed to other reports in the literature, our cohort contained a substantially higher frequency of atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors and a lower frequency of medulloblastoma. Changes in the histologic diagnosis/grade in a significant subset of cases most likely reflect the continual evolution of brain tumor classification schemes. INI-1 immunohistochemistry was instrumental in the pathologic assessment of select cases and raised the possibility that atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors may be the most common infant brain malignancy.",Christopher C;Shibu S;Paul P
22496891,JC virus T-antigen regulates glucose metabolic pathways in brain tumor cells.,"Recent studies have reported the detection of the human neurotropic virus, JCV, in a significant population of brain tumors, including medulloblastomas. Accordingly, expression of the JCV early protein, T-antigen, which has transforming activity in cell culture and in transgenic mice, results in the development of a broad range of tumors of neural crest and glial origin. Evidently, the association of T-antigen with a range of tumor-suppressor proteins, including p53 and pRb, and signaling molecules, such as β-catenin and IRS-1, plays a role in the oncogenic function of JCV T-antigen. We demonstrate that T-antigen expression is suppressed by glucose deprivation in medulloblastoma cells and in glioblastoma xenografts that both endogenously express T-antigen. Mechanistic studies indicate that glucose deprivation-mediated suppression of T-antigen is partly influenced by 5'-activated AMP kinase (AMPK), an important sensor of the AMP/ATP ratio in cells. In addition, glucose deprivation-induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase is blocked with AMPK inhibition, which also prevents T-antigen downregulation. Furthermore, T-antigen prevents G1 arrest and sustains cells in the G2 phase during glucose deprivation. On a functional level, T-antigen downregulation is partially dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during glucose deprivation, and T-antigen prevents ROS induction, loss of ATP production, and cytotoxicity induced by glucose deprivation. Additionally, we have found that T-antigen is downregulated by the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), and the pentose phosphate inhibitors, 6-aminonicotinamide and oxythiamine, and that T-antigen modulates expression of the glycolytic enzyme, hexokinase 2 (HK2), and the pentose phosphate enzyme, transaldolase-1 (TALDO1), indicating a potential link between T-antigen and metabolic regulation. These studies point to the possible involvement of JCV T-antigen in medulloblastoma proliferation and the metabolic phenotype and may enhance our understanding of the role of viral proteins in glycolytic tumor metabolism, thus providing useful targets for the treatment of virus-induced tumors.",Evan E;Ilker Kudret IK;Jennifer J;Kamel K
22485143,Long time to diagnosis of medulloblastoma in children is not associated with decreased survival or with worse neurological outcome.,"The long time to diagnosis of medulloblastoma, one of the most frequent brain tumors in children, is the source of painful remorse and sometimes lawsuits. We analyzed its consequences for tumor stage, survival, and sequelae. This retrospective population-based cohort study included all cases of pediatric medulloblastoma from a region of France between 1990 and 2005. We collected the demographic, clinical, and tumor data and analyzed the relations between the interval from symptom onset until diagnosis, initial disease stage, survival, and neuropsychological and neurological outcome. The median interval from symptom onset until diagnosis for the 166 cases was 65 days (interquartile range 31-121, range 3-457). A long interval (defined as longer than the median) was associated with a lower frequency of metastasis in the univariate and multivariate analyses and with a larger tumor volume, desmoplastic histology, and longer survival in the univariate analysis, but not after adjustment for confounding factors. The time to diagnosis was significantly associated with IQ score among survivors. No significant relation was found between the time to diagnosis and neurological disability. In the 62 patients with metastases, a long prediagnosis interval was associated with a higher T stage, infiltration of the fourth ventricle floor, and incomplete surgical resection; it nonetheless did not influence survival significantly in this subgroup. We found complex and often inverse relations between time to diagnosis of medulloblastoma in children and initial severity factors, survival, and neuropsychological and neurological outcome. This interval appears due more to the nature of the tumor and its progression than to parental or medical factors. These conclusions should be taken into account in the information provided to parents and in expert assessments produced for malpractice claims.",Jean-Francois JF;Jacques J;Francois F;Brigitte B;Dominique D;Stephan S;Olivier O;Nozar N;Stéphanie S;Martin M
22484635,Efficacy and safety of liposomal cytarabine in children with primary CNS tumours with leptomeningeal involvement.,"To assess the efficacy and safety of liposomal cytarabine in the treatment of de novo and relapsed leptomeningeal involvement in children with primary CNS tumours. Data from clinical charts were entered into a database for consecutive unselected patients (n=20) from nine Spanish centres. Diagnosis of leptomeningeal involvement was confirmed by cytology, MRI and/or CT scan. The dose of liposomal cytarabine used varied from 20 to 50 mg, by age. There were 8 females and 12 males, mean age 7.3 years (range 8 months to 18 years). The tumours were: 10 medulloblastomas, 4 ependymomas, 3 primitive neuroectodermal tumours and 3 other tumours. Fourteen had undergone previous chemotherapy and 12 radiotherapy. Nine received concurrent chemotherapy and 2 concurrent radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 244.5 days (range 12- 869). Patients received a median of 5 doses (range 1-9) of liposomal cytarabine. A neurological response (complete or partial) was seen in 11/19 (58%) and a cytological response in 7/10 (64%). Median time to neurological progression exceeded 180 days (range 12-869). Adverse effects were reported in 11/20 patients, but none was grade IV. Liposomal cytarabine was well tolerated and efficacious in this patient group, but prospective randomised trials are needed.",A A;A A;A A;B B;C C;C C;E E;J J;M M;A A
22483529,A severe form of epidermal nevus syndrome associated with brainstem and cerebellar malformations and neonatal medulloblastoma.,"Here we report a boy with epidermal nevus syndrome associated with brainstem and cerebellar malformations and neonatal medulloblastoma. The patient had epidermal nevi and complicated brain malformations including macrocephaly with polymicrogyria, dysmorphic and enlarged midbrain tectum, enlarged cerebellar hemispheres with small and maloriented folia. The patient died after surgical resection of medulloblastoma which was newly recognized on MRI at 51 days of age. Postmortem pathological examinations showed very unique and bizarre malformation of the midbrain and hindbrain. The cerebellar cortex exhibited a coarse, irregular and bumpy surface, blurred border between the Purkinje cell layer and internal granule cell layer, and many foci of heterotopia in the cerebellar white matter. The brainstem showed multiple anomalies, including enlargement of superior colliculi, hypoplasia of pyramidal tracts and dysplasia of inferior olivary nuclei. The unusual constellation of brain malformations of our patient will widen the spectrum of epidermal nevus syndrome.",Akihisa A;Tsubasa T;Mitsuru M;Keiko K;Kazunori K;Yuka Y;Naomi N;Hiroki H;Mitsuyoshi M;Ken K;Hiromichi H;Jun-ichi J;A James AJ;Toshiaki T;Toshiyuki T;Masaharu M
22476608,FABP4 is a candidate marker of cerebellar liponeurocytomas.,"Cerebellar liponeurocytoma (cLPN) is a very rare central nervous system (CNS) tumour recently recognized as a clinical and pathological entity distinct from medulloblastoma (MB), and included in the WHO classification of CNS tumours under the heading ""glioneuronal tumours"". cLPN typically develop in adult age and have a favourable prognosis compared with MB. In this work, we reviewed the clinical and neuroradiological data of two novel cases of adult cLPN diagnosed at our institution; one patient developed distant metastases. We tried to identify novel molecular markers for this malignancy. We found that the transcription factor NEUROG1 (but not ATOH1) is expressed in cLPN, unlike normal adult cerebellum, and that fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), typically found in adipocytes, is significantly overexpressed compared with both normal adult cerebellum and human MB. These findings suggest cLPN occur as a result of transformation of cerebellar progenitors, which are distinct from cerebellar granule progenitors, and aberrantly differentiate into adipocyte-like tumour cells. They also suggest that analysis of FABP4 expression is of help to differentiate cLPN from MB.",Elena E;Marica M;Rosina R;Paolo P;Bianca B;Valeria V;Emanuela E;Giovanni G;Marco M;Ettore E;Gaetano G
22474285,Hedgehog secretion and signal transduction in vertebrates.,"Signaling by the Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted proteins is essential for proper embryonic patterning and development. Dysregulation of Hh signaling is associated with a variety of human diseases ranging from developmental disorders such as holoprosencephaly to certain forms of cancer, including medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma. Genetic studies in flies and mice have shaped our understanding of Hh signaling and revealed that nearly all core components of the pathway are highly conserved. Although many aspects of the Drosophila Hh pathway are conserved in vertebrates, mechanistic differences between the two species have begun to emerge. Perhaps the most striking divergence in vertebrate Hh signaling is its dependence on the primary cilium, a vestigial organelle that is largely absent in flies. This minireview will provide an overview of Hh signaling and present recent insights into vertebrate Hh secretion, receptor binding, and signal transduction.",Kaitlyn E KE;Chin C
22465555,Diagnosis and management of brain and spinal cord tumors in the neonate.,"Congenital central nervous system (CNS) tumors are rare, accounting for <5% of childhood CNS tumors. Although the definition remains arbitrary, 'congenital' is often defined as CNS tumors diagnosed at birth or within a few months after birth. Congenital CNS tumors are now increasingly detected on prenatal ultrasound, with polyhydramnios as the most frequent finding. After delivery, most congenital CNS tumors are associated with macrocrania and hydrocephalus. Teratomas are the most common congenital CNS tumors; other common tumors include astrocytomas, embryonal tumors such as medulloblastomas, and choroid plexus tumors. Choroid plexus tumors (predominantly papillomas) have the best outcome, as aggressive surgical resection can be curative. Other congenital CNS tumors have a collectively poor prognosis, although some subtypes may benefit from complete resections and chemotherapy. Given the rare incidences and diverse pathology of congenital CNS tumors, multicenter studies are required to accurately assess treatment efficacy and outcome measures.",Steven W SW;Jack M JM;Andrew A
22462709,Cerebrospinal fluid shunting and hearing loss in patients treated for medulloblastoma.,"Cerebrospinal fluid shunting has previously been associated with hearing loss. Although the mechanism for this is unclear, it is thought that changes in CSF pressure can affect cochlear physiology via endolymph expansion in the setting of a patent cochlear aqueduct. Patients undergoing radiation and cisplatin chemotherapy are at risk for hearing loss. The authors hypothesized that the incidence and severity of hearing loss in patients undergoing radiation and chemotherapy for medulloblastoma would be greater in those with shunts than in those without shunts. Baseline and longitudinal audiology data were collected in 33 patients with medulloblastoma who were receiving radiation and cisplatin chemotherapy. Additional data included age, sex, details of shunt placement and revision, and details of chemotherapy and radiation. Hearing sensitivity and peripheral auditory function measures included pure tone audiometry, immittance audiometry, and distortion product evoked otoacoustic emissions. Ototoxicity was determined according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria. Severity of hearing loss was determined using the Brock hearing loss grades. Incidence of hearing loss and association with shunting was determined. Thirteen (39.4%) of the 33 patients evaluated had undergone shunt placement. Hearing loss occurred in 14 (70%) of 20 patients without shunts and in 13 (100%) of 13 patients with shunts. The difference between the rates of hearing loss in patients with shunts versus those without the devices was highly significant (p = 0.0008). The odds ratio for hearing loss in patients with a CSF shunt compared with those without a shunt was 23.49 (95% CI 4.21-131.15). Age, side of shunt, evidence of dissemination, diameter of cochlear aqueduct, and treatment protocol did not have a significant effect on shunt-related ototoxicity. This study suggests an independent association between CSF shunting and hearing loss in children undergoing treatment for medulloblastoma, laying the foundation for a prospective study evaluating hearing loss in children with shunts who are not treated with ototoxic therapy.",Daniel J DJ;Kristin K;Carol C;Dale F DF;Dianna M E DM;Edward A EA
22461560,WNT signaling increases proliferation and impairs differentiation of stem cells in the developing cerebellum.,"The WNT pathway plays multiple roles in neural development and is crucial for establishment of the embryonic cerebellum. In addition, WNT pathway mutations are associated with medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor in children. However, the cell types within the cerebellum that are responsive to WNT signaling remain unknown. Here we investigate the effects of canonical WNT signaling on two important classes of progenitors in the developing cerebellum: multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) and granule neuron precursors (GNPs). We show that WNT pathway activation in vitro promotes proliferation of NSCs but not GNPs. Moreover, mice that express activated β-catenin in the cerebellar ventricular zone exhibit increased proliferation of NSCs in that region, whereas expression of the same protein in GNPs impairs proliferation. Although β-catenin-expressing NSCs proliferate they do not undergo prolonged expansion or neoplastic growth; rather, WNT signaling markedly interferes with their capacity for self-renewal and differentiation. At a molecular level, mutant NSCs exhibit increased expression of c-Myc, which might account for their transient proliferation, but also express high levels of bone morphogenetic proteins and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, which might contribute to their altered self-renewal and differentiation. These studies suggest that the WNT pathway is a potent regulator of cerebellar stem cell growth and differentiation.",Yanxin Y;Sonja N SN;Shirley L SL;William W;Paul P;Makoto M MM;Marco M;Richard J RJ;Robert J RJ

22459127,Global gene expression profiling confirms the molecular fidelity of primary tumor-based orthotopic xenograft mouse models of medulloblastoma.,"We previously showed that primary tumor-based orthotopic xenograft mouse models of medulloblastoma replicated the histopathological phenotypes of patients' original tumors. Here, we performed global gene expression profiling of 11 patient-specific xenograft models to further determine whether the xenograft tumors were molecularly accurate during serial subtransplantations in mouse brains and whether they represented all the molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma that were recently described. Analysis of the transcriptomes of 9 pairs of matched passage I xenografts and patients' tumors revealed high correlation coefficients (r(2) > 0.95 in 5 models, > 0.9 in 3 models, and > 0.85 in 1 model) and only identified 69 genes in which expressions were altered (FDR = 0.0023). Subsequent pair-wise comparisons between passage I, III, and V xenografts from the 11 models further showed that no dramatic alterations were introduced (r(2) > 0.9 in 8 models and > 0.8 in 3 models). The genetic abnormalities of each model were then identified through comparison with control RNAs from 5 normal cerebella and 2 fetal brains. Hierarchical clustering using 3 previously published molecular signatures showed that our models span the whole spectrum of molecular subtypes, including SHH (n = 2), WNT (n = 2), and the most recently identified group C (n = 4) and group D (n = 3). In conclusion, we demonstrated that the 11 orthotopic medulloblastoma xenograft models were molecularly faithful to the primary tumors, and our comprehensive collection of molecularly distinct animal models should serve as a valuable resource for the development of new targeted therapies for medulloblastoma.",Xiumei X;Zhigang Z;Litian L;Yujing Y;Patricia P;Horatiu H;Sivashankarappa S;Joseph J;Jack M JM;Hon-chiu Eastwood HC;Xiao-Nan XN
24765436,Medulloblastoma: seeding of VP shunt tract and peritoneum.,"We report on a 5-year-old boy with seeding of the peritoneum and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt tract by anaplastic medulloblastoma. The role of ventriculoperitoneal shunting in the spread of primary central nervous system tumors has been controversial. In the case reported here, the unique distribution of tumor implants on ultrasound and multiplanar computed tomography gives further credence to the argument that ventriculoperitoneal shunting is a pathway for extraneural metastases of primary central nervous system tumors.",David D;Kelli R KR;Jeffrey M JM;Katharine L KL
22454254,Nuclear IRS-1 and cancer.,"The family of insulin receptor substrates (IRS) consists of four proteins (IRS-1-IRS-4), which were initially characterized as typical cytosolic adaptor proteins involved in insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) signaling. The first cloned and characterized member of the IRS family, IRS-1, has a predicted molecular weight of 132 kDa, however, as a result of its extensive serine phosphorylation it separates on a SDS gel as a band of approximately 160-185 kDa. In addition to its metabolic and growth-promoting functions, IRS-1 is also suspected to play a role in malignant transformation. The mechanism by which IRS-1 supports tumor growth is not fully understood, and the argument that IRS-1 merely amplifies the signal from the IGF-1R and/or IR requires further investigation. Almost a decade ago, we reported the presence of nuclear IRS-1 in medulloblastoma clinical samples, which express viral oncoprotein, large T-antigen of human polyomavirus JC (JCV T-antigen). This first demonstration of nuclear IRS-1 was confirmed by several other laboratories. Nuclear IRS-1 was also detected by cells expressing the SV40 T-antigen, v-Src, in immortalized fibroblasts stimulated with IGF-I, in hepatocytes, 32D cells, and in an osteosarcoma cell line. More recently, nuclear IRS-1 was detected in breast cancer cells in association with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), and in JC virus negative medulloblastoma cells expressing estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), further implicating nuclear IRS-1 in cellular transformation. Here, we discuss how nuclear IRS-1 acting on DNA repair fidelity, transcriptional activity, and cell growth can support tumor development and progression.",Krzysztof K;Luis L;Adam A;Joanna J
22452947,Off-target function of the Sonic hedgehog inhibitor cyclopamine in mediating apoptosis via nitric oxide-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase 2/ceramide induction.,"Sonic hedgehog (SHh) signaling is important in the pathogenesis of various human cancers, such as medulloblastomas, and it has been identified as a valid target for anticancer therapeutics. The SHh inhibitor cyclopamine induces apoptosis. The bioactive sphingolipid ceramide mediates cell death in response to various chemotherapeutic agents; however, ceramide's roles/mechanisms in cyclopamine-induced apoptosis are unknown. Here, we report that cyclopamine mediates ceramide generation selectively via induction of neutral sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3, SMPD3 (nSMase2) in Daoy human medulloblastoma cells. Importantly, short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of nSMase2 prevented cyclopamine-induced ceramide generation and protected Daoy cells from drug-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, ectopic wild-type N-SMase2 caused cell death, compared with controls, which express the catalytically inactive N-SMase2 mutant. Interestingly, knockdown of smoothened (Smo), a target protein for cyclopamine, or Gli1, a downstream signaling transcription factor of Smo, did not affect nSMase2. Mechanistically, our data showed that cyclopamine induced nSMase2 and cell death selectively via increased nitric oxide (NO) generation by neuronal-nitric oxide synthase (n-NOS) induction, in Daoy medulloblastoma, and multiple other human cancer cell lines. Knockdown of n-NOS prevented nSMase2 induction and cell death in response to cyclopamine. Accordingly, N-SMase2 activity-deficient skin fibroblasts isolated from homozygous fro/fro (fragilitas ossium) mice exhibited resistance to NO-induced cell death. Thus, our data suggest a novel off-target function of cyclopamine in inducing apoptosis, at least in part, by n-NOS/NO-dependent induction of N-SMase2/ceramide axis, independent of Smo/Gli inhibition.",Marisa M;Jocelyn A JA;Salih S;R David RD;Sahar A SA;Christopher J CJ;Yusuf A YA;Haakan H;Telma Martins TM;Michael M;Jacqueline M JM;Zohreh Z;Monzur M;M Ozgur MO;Besim B
22447520,Molecular genetic analysis of the hepatocyte growth factor/MET signaling pathway in pediatric medulloblastoma.,"The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/MET pathway plays a critical role in the development of the nervous system and has been implicated in medulloblastoma pathogenesis. Recent studies have shown a role for gene amplification of activators of this pathway, as well as silencing of its inhibitors in medulloblastoma pathogenesis. We analyzed exon array data from a cohort of 103 primary medulloblastomas to show that HGF/MET pathway elements are dysregulated in tumors compared to normal cerebellum. To determine if mutation of HGF/MET pathway genes is a mechanism for pathway dysregulation, we conducted a mutational analysis by exon resequencing of three key components of this pathway, including serine protease inhibitor Kunitz-type 1 (SPINT1), serine protease inhibitor Kunitz-type 2 (SPINT2), and MET, in 32 primary human medulloblastoma specimens. From this analysis, we identified multiple coding synonymous and nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in these genes among the 32 tumor samples. Interestingly, we also discovered two unreported sequence variants in SPINT1 and SPINT2 in two tumors that resulted in Arginine to Histidine amino acid substitutions at codons 418 and 233, respectively. However, conservation assessment and functional assays of these two variants indicate that they involve nonconserved residues and that they do not affect the function of SPINT1 and SPINT2 as tumor suppressor genes. In conclusion, our data suggest that mutation alone plays a minor role in causing aberrancies of the HGF/MET pathway in medulloblastoma in comparison with other malignancies such as breast, hepatocellular, renal, and lung carcinomas.",Sara S;Yuzo Y;Christian C;Paul P;Michael M;James J
22439007,Inhibition of ERβ induces resistance to cisplatin by enhancing Rad51-mediated DNA repair in human medulloblastoma cell lines.,"Cisplatin is one of the most widely used and effective anticancer drugs against solid tumors including cerebellar tumor of the childhood, Medulloblastoma. However, cancer cells often develop resistance to cisplatin, which limits therapeutic effectiveness of this otherwise effective genotoxic drug. In this study, we demonstrate that human medulloblastoma cell lines develop acute resistance to cisplatin in the presence of estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, ICI182,780. This unexpected finding involves a switch from the G2/M to G1 checkpoint accompanied by decrease in ATM/Chk2 and increase in ATR/Chk1 phosphorylation. We have previously reported that ERβ, which is highly expressed in medulloblastomas, translocates insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) to the nucleus, and that nuclear IRS-1 binds to Rad51 and attenuates homologous recombination directed DNA repair (HRR). Here, we demonstrate that in the presence of ICI182,780, cisplatin-treated medulloblastoma cells show recruitment of Rad51 to the sites of damaged DNA and increase in HRR activity. This enhanced DNA repair during the S phase preserved also clonogenic potential of medulloblastoma cells treated with cisplatin. In conclusion, inhibition of ERβ considered as a supplemental anticancer therapy, has been found to interfere with cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in human medulloblastoma cell lines.",Anna A;Agnieszka A;Piotr P;Augusto A;Krzysztof K
22438824,Nos2 inactivation promotes the development of medulloblastoma in Ptch1(+/-) mice by deregulation of Gap43-dependent granule cell precursor migration.,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. A subset of medulloblastoma originates from granule cell precursors (GCPs) of the developing cerebellum and demonstrates aberrant hedgehog signaling, typically due to inactivating mutations in the receptor PTCH1, a pathomechanism recapitulated in Ptch1(+/-) mice. As nitric oxide may regulate GCP proliferation and differentiation, we crossed Ptch1(+/-) mice with mice lacking inducible nitric oxide synthase (Nos2) to investigate a possible influence on tumorigenesis. We observed a two-fold higher medulloblastoma rate in Ptch1(+/-) Nos2(-/-) mice compared to Ptch1(+/-) Nos2(+/+) mice. To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this finding, we performed gene expression profiling of medulloblastomas from both genotypes, as well as normal cerebellar tissue samples of different developmental stages and genotypes. Downregulation of hedgehog target genes was observed in postnatal cerebellum from Ptch1(+/+) Nos2(-/-) mice but not from Ptch1(+/-) Nos2(-/-) mice. The most consistent effect of Nos2 deficiency was downregulation of growth-associated protein 43 (Gap43). Functional studies in neuronal progenitor cells demonstrated nitric oxide dependence of Gap43 expression and impaired migration upon Gap43 knock-down. Both effects were confirmed in situ by immunofluorescence analyses on tissue sections of the developing cerebellum. Finally, the number of proliferating GCPs at the cerebellar periphery was decreased in Ptch1(+/+) Nos2(-/-) mice but increased in Ptch1(+/-) Nos2(-/) (-) mice relative to Ptch1(+/-) Nos2(+/+) mice. Taken together, these results indicate that Nos2 deficiency promotes medulloblastoma development in Ptch1(+/-) mice through retention of proliferating GCPs in the external granular layer due to reduced Gap43 expression. This study illustrates a new role of nitric oxide signaling in cerebellar development and demonstrates that the localization of pre-neoplastic cells during morphogenesis is crucial for their malignant progression.",Daniel D;Petra P;Viola V;Daniela D;Karin K;Grischa G;Frederik F;Nicolas N;Meinhard M;Julia J;Guido G;Peter P
22430583,Once-daily intravenous busulfan for 47 pediatric patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a single center study.,"We report our results using once-daily intravenous (IV) busulfan (Bu)-based conditioning adjusted by weight without drug monitoring as myeloablative conditioning in 47 pediatric patients undergoing first autologous hematopoietic transplantation from 2006 to 2010. Median age was 4 years (range, 1 to 22 y). There were 35 boys and 12 girls. Conditioning was Bu-based in all patients. In medulloblastoma patients (n=12), IV thiotepa at 5 mg/kg/d×2 days was associated with Bu. In solid tumors other than medulloblastoma, IV melphalan was used at 140 mg/m/d×1 day. In lymphoma patients (n=9), IV cyclophosphamide was used at 60 mg/kg/d×2 days. Median number of CD34 cells infused was 4.65×10/kg (range, 1.7 to 58.7×10/kg). Median times to neutrophil and platelet recovery (>20×10/L) were 11 days (range, 8 to 16 d) and 12 days (range, 7 to 135 d), respectively. Median hospitalization time was 14 days (range, 9 to 92 d). Sixteen patients developed grades III and IV mucositis. Only 1 patient developed mild sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. No patient developed seizures or severe neurological complications. With a median follow-up of 18 months, probability of transplantation-related mortality and disease-free survival were 0% and 70%±8%, respectively. In conclusion, in our experience, once-daily IV Bu-based conditioning without drug monitoring for autologous hematopoietic transplantation in pediatric patients is a safe and effective regimen with no mortality.",Marta M;Blanca B;Antonio A;Miguel Angel MA
22430388,Medulloblastoma stem cells: where development and cancer cross pathways.,"Brain tumors are the leading cause of childhood cancer mortality, with medulloblastoma (MB) representing the most frequent malignant tumor. The recent molecular classification of MB has reconceptualized the heterogeneity that exists within pathological subtypes by giving context to the role of key developmental signaling pathways in MB pathogenesis. The identification of cancer stem cell (CSC) populations, termed brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs), in MB has provided novel cellular targets for the study of these aberrantly activated signaling pathways, namely, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Wingless (Wnt), along with the identification of novel BTIC self-renewal pathways. In this review, we discuss recent evidence for the presence of a MB stem cell that drives tumorigenesis in this malignant childhood tumor. We focus on evidence from cerebellar development, the recent identification of BTICs, the presence of activated developmental signaling pathways in MB, the role of epigenetic stem cell regulatory mechanisms, and how these developmental and epigenetic pathways may be targeted for novel therapeutic options.",Branavan B;Chitra C;Nicole N;Bradley W BW;Sandra E SE;Katrin K;Sheila K SK
22428665,Detection of endocrine disruptors - from simple assays to whole genome scanning.,"Endocrine disruptors frequently bear little structural relationship to the hormone whose actions they disrupt. Consequently, the threat of an uninvestigated chemical cannot easily be assessed. Here three different approaches to assessment are discussed. The first presumes an endocrine-disrupting property, following which a cell model capable of responding to such a hormone is used. Although simple and cheap, it provides limited data. A second approach involves multiple assays to detect multiple hormones. Increasing the amount of data increased the difficulty in assessing the significance of results. To meet this problem, cluster analysis based on a simple mathematical matrix was adopted. The matrix was used to determine (i) a limited number of assays to identify a maximum number of endocrine disruptors and (ii) the chemicals with the most wide-ranging effects. A third approach was a whole genome expression analysis based on expression of mRNAs in human TE671 medulloblastoma cells. Expression of individual mRNAs was assessed using the Affymetrix GeneChip(®) Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 chip. The significance of differential expressed genes was assessed based on gene ontology and pathways analyses using DAVID and GenMaPP programs. The results illustrated the very wide-ranging effects of these chemicals across the genome.",E E;N N;P W-L PW;S-L SL;P D B PD;R H RH;D B DB
22428049,RNA-binding protein Musashi1 modulates glioma cell growth through the post-transcriptional regulation of Notch and PI3 kinase/Akt signaling pathways.,"Musashi1 (MSI1) is an RNA-binding protein that plays critical roles in nervous-system development and stem-cell self-renewal. Here, we examined its role in the progression of glioma. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based MSI1-knock down (KD) in glioblastoma and medulloblastoma cells resulted in a significantly lower number of self renewing colony on day 30 (a 65% reduction), compared with non-silencing shRNA-treated control cells, indicative of an inhibitory effect of MSI1-KD on tumor cell growth and survival. Immunocytochemical staining of the MSI1-KD glioblastoma cells indicated that they ectopically expressed metaphase markers. In addition, a 2.2-fold increase in the number of MSI1-KD cells in the G2/M phase was observed. Thus, MSI1-KD caused the prolongation of mitosis and reduced the cell survival, although the expression of activated Caspase-3 was unaltered. We further showed that MSI1-KD glioblastoma cells xenografted into the brains of NOD/SCID mice formed tumors that were 96.6% smaller, as measured by a bioluminescence imaging system (BLI), than non-KD cells, and the host survival was longer (49.3±6.1 days vs. 33.6±3.6 days; P<0.01). These findings and other cell biological analyses suggested that the reduction of MSI1 in glioma cells prolonged the cell cycle by inducing the accumulation of Cyclin B1. Furthermore, MSI1-KD reduced the activities of the Notch and PI(3) kinase-Akt signaling pathways, through the up-regulation of Numb and PTEN, respectively. Exposure of glioma cells to chemical inhibitors of these pathways reduced the number of spheres and living cells, as did MSI1-KD. These results suggest that MSI1 increases the growth and/or survival of certain types of glioma cells by promoting the activation of both Notch and PI(3) kinase/Akt signaling.",Jun J;Takao T;Daisuke D;Yoshinori Y;Yohei Y;Yo Y;Takeshi T;Akio A;Paul S PS;Hideyuki H;Kazunari K;Yumi Y;Hideyuki H

22420547,Cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and heterocyclic compounds at application on the cells of primary culture of neuroepithelium tumors.,"Neuroepithelial tumor cells were cultured in vitro. The biopsy material was taken from 93 children at removal of the brain tumors during neurosurgical operations. The individual features of the cells sensitivity of primary cultures in respect to protocol-approved chemotherapy drugs and changes in the Interleukin-6 (Il-6) level in the culture medium after the application of chemotherapy were established. The initial level of Il-6 exceeded 600.0 pg/ml in the cultural medium with histologically verified pilomyxoid astrocytoma cells, and ranged from 100.0 to 200.0 pg/ml in the medium at cultivation of ganglioneuroblastoma and pilocytic astrocytoma. A decrease in the Il-6 level in the medium culture of primary tumors cells was observed after the application of chemotherapeutic agents on the cells of pilomyxoid astrocytoma, astrocytomas, and pilocytic desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma. The production of Il-6 increased after application of cytostatic drugs on the cells of oligoastrocytomas. A decrease in Il-6 level after application of Cisplatin and Methotrexate and a 5-10 fold increase in the level of Il-6 after application of Etoposide, Carboplatin, Cytarabine, and Gemcitabine were registered in the medium with ganglioneuroblastoma. To improve the cytotoxic action of chemotherapeutic agents, the combined application of cytostatics with heterocyclic compounds was carried out. A computer modeling of ligand-protein complexes of carbamide using the Dock 6.4 and USF Chimera program packages was performed with molecular mechanics method. Special attention was drawn to the ability of several isoxazole heterocycles and isothiazolyl to inhibit the tyrosine kinase. It was proved in vitro that the joint application of chemotherapeutic agents and heterocyclic compounds could reduce the concentration of the cytostatic factor by 10 or more times, having maintained the maximum cytotoxic effect. It was assumed that the target amplification of cytotoxic action of chemotherapeutic agents had prospects for reducing toxic side effects of chemotherapy in vivo, which would be carried out only after the preclinical studies.",Vladimir A VA;Vladimir I VI;Yuri S YS;Alexander N AN;Michael V MV;Yuri E YE;Sergei K SK;Vladimir V VV;Tatiana A TA;Margarita O MO;Dmitry G DG;Alexei V AV;Vladimir N VN
22415382,Primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system associated with genetic and metabolic defects.,"To evaluate the genetic, congenital and metabolic disorders which were detected concurrently with primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) of the central nervous system in children. Medical records of 1030 children who were admitted to our department with diagnosis of brain tumor between 1975 and 2005 were reviewed retrospectively. Medulloblastoma and supratentorial PNETs were detected in 289 patients. They were reviewed for associated metabolic conditions, genetic and congenital defects. One of the following conditions were detected in 10 patients with medulloblastoma and supratentorial PNETs: Neurofibromatosis type 1, Gorlin syndrome, juvenile polyposis coli, cancer prone syndrome of total premature chromatid separation and Fanconi anemia, bilateral retinoblastoma, L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, Gilbert syndrome, gray platelet syndrome, cleft lip-palate and left renal agenesis. In the patients with multiple malignant diseases, cancer prone syndrome of total premature chromatid separation and Fanconi anemia, Gorlin syndrome and juvenile polyposis coli were diagnosed after diagnosis of the malignant tumors. Medulloblastoma was the first manifestation in the case with Gorlin syndrome. In case with retinoblastoma, pineal PNET was detected 2 months after diagnosis of retinoblastoma. Cleft lip-palate and L-2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria were detected previously in the patients before their brain tumors whereas Gray platelet, Gilbert syndrome and left renal agenesis were diagnosed during treatment of medulloblastoma. Associated genetic, metabolic and congenital conditions were detected in 3.5% of the cases. Thus the patients with PNET should be followed for these defects.",A A;N N;N N;B B;C C;T T;M M
22415315,Molecular pathways: the role of primary cilia in cancer progression and therapeutics with a focus on Hedgehog signaling.,"Abnormal Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activity has been reported in many cancers, including basal cell carcinomas, medulloblastomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, glioblastomas, and breast and prostate cancers. For this reason, the Hh pathway is a flourishing area for development of anticancer drugs such as Hh ligand antagonists (e.g., 5E1 and robotnikinin), Smo inhibitors (e.g., GDC-0449 and IPI-926), and Gli transcriptional activity inhibitors (e.g., GANT58 and GANT61). It is now clear that primary cilia are required for activation of the Hh pathway in normal vertebrate cells. It is in the primary cilium that both positive and negative effectors of the Hh pathway are processed by posttranslational modifications. In many cancers, preliminary results suggest that primary cilia are lost. As drugs that inhibit different steps of the Hh pathway are developed, it will be important to consider how these drugs will function in the context of primary cilia in the tumor environment. Here, we discuss why some of the Hh inhibitors may be ineffective if primary cilia are lost on cancer cells. Understanding the relationships between clinical inhibitors of the Hh pathway and the presence or absence of primary cilia may turn out to be critical for targeting these therapeutics to the correct population of patients and improving their efficacy. Further work is needed in this area to maximize the potential of these exciting therapeutic targets.",Nadia B NB;Thomas A TA;Kimberly M KM
22411914,"The micro-RNA 199b-5p regulatory circuit involves Hes1, CD15, and epigenetic modifications in medulloblastoma.","Micro-RNA (miR) 199b-5p targets Hes1 in medulloblastoma, one of the downstream effectors of both the canonical Notch and noncanonical Sonic Hedgehog pathways. In medulloblastoma patients, expression of miR-199b-5p is significantly decreased in metastatic cases, thus suggesting a downregulation mechanism. We studied this mechanism, which is mediated mostly by Hes1 and epigenetic promoter modifications. The miR-199b-5p promoter region was characterized, which identified a Hes1 binding site, thus demonstrating a negative feedback loop of regulation. MiR-199b-5p was shown to be downregulated in several medulloblastoma cell lines and in tumors by epigenetic methylation of a cytosine-phosphate-guanine island upstream of the miR-199b-5p promoter. Furthermore, the cluster of differention (CD) carbohydrate antigen CD15, a marker of medulloblastoma tumor-propagating cells, is an additional direct target of miR-199b-5p. Most importantly, regulation of miR-199b-5p expression in these CD15+/CD133+ tumor-propagating cells was influenced by only Hes1 expression and not by any epigenetic mechanism of regulation. Moreover, reverse-phase protein array analysis showed both the Akt and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase pathways as being mainly negatively regulated by miR-199b-5p expression in several medulloblastoma cell lines and in primary cell cultures. We present here the finely tuned regulation of miR-199b-5p in medulloblastoma, underlining its crucial role by its additional targeting of CD15.",Immacolata I;Lucia L;Pasqualino P;Emilio E;Federica F;Francesca F;Livia L;Gennaro G;Giuseppe G;Benedetta B;Roberta R;Giuseppe G;Achille A;Giuseppe G;Massimo M

22407012,Hedgehog-mediated regulation of PPARγ controls metabolic patterns in neural precursors and shh-driven medulloblastoma.,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling is critical during development and its aberration is common across the spectrum of human malignancies. In the cerebellum, excessive activity of the Shh signaling pathway is associated with the devastating pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma. We previously demonstrated that exaggerated de novo lipid synthesis is a hallmark of Shh-driven medulloblastoma and that hedgehog signaling inactivates the Rb/E2F tumor suppressor complex to promote lipogenesis. Indeed, such Shh-mediated metabolic reprogramming fuels tumor progression, in an E2F1- and FASN-dependent manner. Here, we show that the nutrient sensor PPARγ is a key component of the Shh metabolic network, particularly its regulation of glycolysis. Our data show that in primary cerebellar granule neural precursors (CGNPs), proposed medulloblastoma cells-of-origin, Shh stimulation elicits a marked induction of PPARγ alongside major glycolytic markers. This is also documented in the actively proliferating Shh-responsive CGNPs in the developing cerebellum, and PPARγ expression is strikingly elevated in Shh-driven medulloblastoma in vivo. Importantly, pharmacological blockade of PPARγ and/or Rb inactivation inhibits CGNP proliferation, drives medulloblastoma cell death and extends survival of medulloblastoma-bearing animals in vivo. This coupling of mitogenic Shh signaling to a major nutrient sensor and metabolic transcriptional regulator define a novel mechanism through which Shh signaling engages the nutrient sensing machinery in brain cancer, controls the cell cycle, and regulates the glycolytic index. This also reveals a dominant role of Shh in the etiology of glucose metabolism in medulloblastoma and underscores the function of the Shh → E2F1 → PPARγ axis in altering substrate utilization patterns in brain cancers in favor of tumor growth. These findings emphasize the value of PPARγ downstream of Shh as a global therapeutic target in hedgehog-dependent and/or Rb-inactivated tumors.",Bobby B;Chad R CR;Cemile C;SunPhil S;Andrey A;Stefan S;Anna M AM;Zaher A ZA
22406992,Sorafenib and HDAC inhibitors synergize to kill CNS tumor cells.,"The present studies were designed to determine whether the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib (Nexavar) interacted with histone deacetylase inhibitors to kill glioblastoma and medulloblastoma cells. In a dose-dependent fashion sorafenib lethality was enhanced in multiple genetically disparate primary human glioblastoma isolates by the HDAC inhibitor sodium valproate (Depakote). Drug exposure reduced phosphorylation of p70 S6K and of mTOR. Similar data to that with valproate were also obtained using the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat (Zolinza). Sorafenib and valproate also interacted to kill medulloblastoma and PNET cell lines. Treatment with sorafenib and HDAC inhibitors radio-sensitized both GBM and medulloblastoma cell lines. Knock down of death receptor (CD95) expression protected GBM cells from the drug combination, as did overexpression of c-FLIP-s, BCL-XL and dominant negative caspase 9. Knock down of PDGFRα recapitulated the effect of sorafenib in combination with HDAC inhibitors. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the combination of sorafenib and HDAC inhibitors kills through activation of the extrinsic pathway, and could represent a useful approach to treat CNS-derived tumors.",Yong Y;Adly A;Hossein A HA;Andrew A;Gary G;Steven S;Paul P
22402744,"Pleiotropic effects of miR-183~96~182 converge to regulate cell survival, proliferation and migration in medulloblastoma.","Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in children. Several large-scale genomic studies have detailed their heterogeneity, defining multiple subtypes with unique molecular profiles and clinical behavior. Increased expression of the miR-183~96~182 cluster of microRNAs has been noted in several subgroups, including the most clinically aggressive subgroup associated with genetic amplification of MYC. To understand the contribution of miR-183~96~182 to the pathogenesis of this aggressive subtype of medulloblastoma, we analyzed global gene expression and proteomic changes that occur upon modulation of miRNAs in this cluster individually and as a group in MYC-amplified medulloblastoma cells. Knockdown of the full miR-183~96~182 cluster results in enrichment of genes associated with apoptosis and dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis. Conversely, there is a relative enrichment of pathways associated with migration, metastasis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition, as well as pathways associated with dysfunction of DNA repair in cells with preserved miR-183 cluster expression. Immunocytochemistry and FACS analysis confirm induction of apoptosis upon knockdown of the miR-183 cluster. Importantly, cell-based migration and invasion assays verify the positive regulation of cell motility/migration by the miR-183 cluster, which is largely mediated by miR-182. We show that the effects on cell migration induced by the miR-183 cluster are coupled to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway through differential regulation of AKT1 and AKT2 isoforms. Furthermore, we show that rapamycin inhibits cell motility/migration in medulloblastoma cells and phenocopies miR-183 cluster knockdown. Thus, the miR-183 cluster regulates multiple biological programs that converge to support the maintenance and metastatic potential of medulloblastoma.",Shyamal Dilhan SD;Vladimir V;Natalia N;Jessica J;Dominic D;Min Jeong MJ;Soma S;Tenley T;Marc M;Alfa H C AH;Peter P;Stefan M SM;Judith A J JA;Scott L SL;Yoon-Jae YJ
22402322,Neural stem cell-mediated CE/CPT-11 enzyme/prodrug therapy in transgenic mouse model of intracerebellar medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma is a heterogeneous diffuse neoplasm that can be highly disseminated, and is the most common malignant childhood brain tumor. Although multimodal treatments have improved survival rates for patients with medulloblastoma, these tumors are associated with high morbidity and mortality. New treatment strategies are urgently needed to improve cure rates and, importantly, to spare normal brain tissue from neurotoxicity and patients from life-long cognitive and functional deficits associated with current therapies. In numerous preclinical brain tumor models, neural stem cells (NSCs) have shown great promise as delivery vehicles for therapeutic genes. Here, we have used an established, genetically modified human NSC line (HB1.F3.CD) to deliver carboxylesterase (CE) to cerebellar tumor foci and locally activate the prodrug camptothecin-11 (CPT-11) (Irinotecan) to the potent topoisomerase I inhibitor SN-38. HB1.F3.CD NSC tumor tropism, intratumoral distribution and therapeutic efficacy were investigated in clinically relevant experimental models. Magnetic resonance imaging was used for in vivo tracking of iron nanoparticle-labeled NSCs, and to assess the therapeutic efficacy of CE-expressing HB1.F3.CD cells. As compared with controls, a significant decrease in tumor growth rate was seen in mice that received both NSCs and CPT-11 as their treatment regimen. Thus, this study provides proof-of-concept for NSC-mediated CE/CPT-11 treatment of medulloblastoma, and serves as a foundation for further studies toward potential clinical application.",M M;G M GM;V V;K A KA;X-H XH;K K;Y Y;M S MS;S U SU;A J AJ;J J;T W TW;M M;M E ME;R A RA;K S KS
22399356,Notch signaling and brain tumors.,"Human brain tumors are a heterogenous group of neoplasms occurring inside the cranium and the central spinal cord. In adults and children, astrocytic glioma and medulloblastoma are the most common subtypes of primary brain tumors. These tumor types are thought to arise from cells in which Notch signaling plays a fundamental role during development. Recent findings have shown that Notch signaling is dysregulated and contributes to the malignant potential of these tumors. Growing evidence point towards an important role for cancer stem cells in the initiation and maintenance of glioma and medulloblastoma. In this chapter we will cover the present findings of Notch signaling in human glioma and medulloblastoma and try to create an overall picture of its relevance in the pathogenesis of these tumors.",Marie-Thérése MT;Karina K;Hans Skovgaard HS

22391319,Hedgehog inhibition as an anti-cancer strategy.,"Dysregulated Hedgehog (Hh) signaling has been implicated in a growing number of human cancers. Although first identified as an important developmental signaling pathway crucial for cellular proliferation, differentiation, and migration during organogenesis in invertebrates, these fundamental processes have been co-opted in human cancers. Initial evidence for the Hh pathway in tumor biology comes from mutations of signaling pathway components in a hereditary cancer syndrome that typically results in basal-cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma. Subsequent analysis revealed that Hh pathway mutations are found in sporadic tumors as well as activated Hh signaling in several epithelial cancers independent of Hh pathway mutation status. Further, recent evidence has demonstrated paracrine Hh signaling within stromal cells of the tumor microenvironment with implications for drug delivery. Several Hh antagonists targeting the Hh receptor, Smoothened (SMO), have been developed and show efficacy in preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials in humans. However, major issues with these small molecule compounds include rapid acquired resistance, potential developmental toxicities secondary to use in children, and limited efficacy in cancers driven by Hh signaling downstream of the SMO receptor.",G Praveen GP;Diane D
22391316,Activation of Hedgehog pathway in gastrointestinal cancers.,"The hedgehog (Hh) pathway is a major regulator for cell differentiation, tissue polarity, and cell proliferation in embryonic development and homeostasis in adult tissue. Studies from many laboratories reveal activation of this pathway in a variety of human cancer, including basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), medulloblastomas, leukemia, gastrointestinal, lung, ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers. It is thus believed that targeted inhibition of Hh signaling may be effective in treatment and prevention of human cancer. Even more exciting is the discovery and synthesis of specific signaling antagonists for the Hh pathway, which have significant clinical implications in novel cancer therapeutics. In this review, we summarize major advances in the past 2 years in our understanding of Hh signaling activation in human gastrointestinal cancer and their potential in clinical treatment with Hh pathway inhibitors.",Ling L;Xiulan X;Jingwu J
22391311,A new era for an ancient drug: arsenic trioxide and Hedgehog signaling.,"Arsenic has been used for ages as a therapeutic agent. Currently, it is an FDA approved drug to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia where it leads to degradation of the PML-RAR fusion protein. It has been shown to have various other targets in cells such as JNK, NFκB, thioredoxin reductase, and MAPK pathways. Most of its effects in cells have been through arsenic's ability to bind to thiol groups in cysteine residues. Recent evidence has shown that arsenic can inhibit the Hedgehog pathway by inhibiting GLI proteins. The proposed mechanism of action is through direct binding. Potential binding sites include the critical cysteine residues in GLI zinc finger domains. The role of the Hedgehog pathway has been implicated in many cancers such as basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and rhabdoid tumors. Current Hedgehog pathway inhibitors have been fraught with resistance issues and so arsenic trioxide may provide an alternative therapy when combined with these other inhibitors or after acquired resistance.",Elspeth M EM;Aykut A
22390279,Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibition suppresses cell growth and enhances radiation sensitivity in medulloblastoma cells.,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children and remains a therapeutic challenge due to its significant therapy-related morbidity. Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is highly expressed in many cancers and regulates critical steps in mitotic progression. Recent studies suggest that targeting PLK1 with small molecule inhibitors is a promising approach to tumor therapy. We examined the expression of PLK1 mRNA in medulloblastoma tumor samples using microarray analysis. The impact of PLK1 on cell proliferation was evaluated by depleting expression with RNA interference (RNAi) or by inhibiting function with the small molecule inhibitor BI 2536. Colony formation studies were performed to examine the impact of BI 2536 on medulloblastoma cell radiosensitivity. In addition, the impact of depleting PLK1 mRNA on tumor-initiating cells was evaluated using tumor sphere assays. Analysis of gene expression in two independent cohorts revealed that PLK1 mRNA is overexpressed in some, but not all, medulloblastoma patient samples when compared to normal cerebellum. Inhibition of PLK1 by RNAi significantly decreased medulloblastoma cell proliferation and clonogenic potential and increased cell apoptosis. Similarly, a low nanomolar concentration of BI 2536, a small molecule inhibitor of PLK1, potently inhibited cell growth, strongly suppressed the colony-forming ability, and increased cellular apoptosis of medulloblastoma cells. Furthermore, BI 2536 pretreatment sensitized medulloblastoma cells to ionizing radiation. Inhibition of PLK1 impaired tumor sphere formation of medulloblastoma cells and decreased the expression of SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2) mRNA in tumor spheres indicating a possible role in targeting tumor initiating cells. Our data suggest that targeting PLK1 with small molecule inhibitors, in combination with radiation therapy, is a novel strategy in the treatment of medulloblastoma that warrants further investigation.",Peter S PS;Sujatha S;Irina I;Diane K DK;Andrew M AM;Jeffrey J;Adrian A;Michael D MD;Michael H MH;Nicholas K NK;Rajeev R
22389292,An exploratory case-only analysis of gene-hazardous air pollutant interactions and the risk of childhood medulloblastoma.,"There is evidence that exposure to chlorinated solvents may be associated with childhood medulloblastoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (M/PNET) risk. Animal models suggest genes related to detoxification and DNA repair are important in the carcinogenicity of these pollutants; however, there have been no human studies assessing the modifying effects of these genotypes on the association between chlorinated solvents and childhood M/PNET risk. We conducted a case-only study to evaluate census tract-level exposure to chlorinated solvents and the risk of childhood M/PNET in the context of detoxification and DNA repair genotypes. Cases (n = 98) were obtained from Texas Children's Hospital and MD Anderson Cancer Center. Key genotypes (n = 22) were selected from the Illumina Human 1M Quad SNP Chip. Exposure to chlorinated solvents (methylene chloride, perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, and vinyl chloride) was estimated from the US EPA's 1999 Assessment System for Population Exposure Nationwide (ASPEN). Logistic regression was used to estimate the case-only odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). There were 11 significant gene-environment interactions associated with childhood M/PNET risk. However, after correcting for multiple comparisons, only the interaction between high trichloroethylene levels and OGG1 rs293795 significantly increased the risk of childhood M/PNET risk (OR = 9.24, 95% CI: 2.24, 38.24, Q = 0.04). This study provides an initial assessment of the interaction between ambient levels of chlorinated solvents and potentially relevant genotypes on childhood M/PNET risk.

22385801,Epidemiology of pediatric primary tumors of the nervous system: a retrospective study of 633 cases from a single Moroccan institution.,"There are several reports regarding the epidemiology of pediatric brain tumors. However, little is known about the profile of pediatric brain tumors in Africa especially in Morocco in particular. The authors report the results of epidemiological analysis of a retrospective review of childhood primary brain tumors in a single institution. A retrospective review of all cases of primary brain from 1 month to 15 years diagnosed at the Department of Pathology of the Hospital of Specialities of Rabat between January 1991 and December 2009 was performed. Six hundred and thirty-three primary tumors of the central nervous system were reviewed with a mean of 33.31 cases per year. According to the gender, 55% of the tumors occurred in males and 45% in females. The mean age was 8.36 years. Of all the tumors, 47% were situated in the supratentorial compartment, 48% in the infratentorial compartment, and 5% in spinal cord. In the infratentorial compartment, 82% of tumors are located in the cerebellum, 15% in the fourth ventricle, 2% in the brain stem and 1% in the cerebellar pontine angle. In the supratentorial compartment, two third of the tumors were located in the cerebral hemispheres and the sellar region. Thus 39% of tumors are located in the cerebral hemispheres followed by the sellar/suprasellar region (30%), lateral and third ventricles (11%), pineal region (8%), meninges (5%), choroid plexus (4%), and optic chiasma/tracts (3%). The most common types of tumors diagnosed were pilocytic astrocytoma and medulloblastoma together accounting for nearly half of the cases (46%) (23.1% and 22.9% respectively), followed by craniopharyngiomas (9%), ependymomas grade II (6.5%), glioblastomas (6%), astrocytomas grade II (4.4%), ependymomas grade III (3.9%). The other tumors represent 22.6%. We think that our results reflect fairly well the incidence of tumors of the nervous system in children due to the fact that this study was performed through many years in a single institution with a homogeneous neuropathological approach.",A A;M M;A A;M M;S S
22380961,Establishing successful cerebrospinal fluid flow for radioimmunotherapy.,"Successful delivery of intraventricular radioimmunotherapy is contingent on adequate CSF flow. The authors present a patient with medulloblastoma in whom obstructed CSF flow was causing hydrocephalus, which was initially corrected by implantation of a programmable shunting device. While managing the hydrocephalus, an endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) needed to be performed in a collapsed ventricular system to ensure adequate radioimmunotherapy distribution. This 18-month-old patient with medulloblastoma involving leptomeningeal dissemination presented for intraventricular radioimmunotherapy. A CSF (111)In-DTPA scintigraphy study obtained through the existing programmable ventriculoperitoneal shunt demonstrated activity in the lateral and third ventricles, but no activity over the cerebral convexities or spinal canal, consistent with obstruction at the level of the cerebral aqueduct. By maximization of ventricular size in a controlled setting, the patient was able to undergo a trial of ETV through very small ventricles. A postoperative CINE MR imaging study confirmed patent ETV. The pressure settings on the shunt were kept at the highest opening pressure (200 mm H(2)O) to maximize flow through the stoma and improve the distribution of CSF throughout the subarachnoid space. The CSF flow scintigraphy study was again performed, this time with tracer activity demonstrated down the thecal sac at 3 hours, and symmetrically over the cerebral convexities at 24 hours. The patient began weekly intraventricular administration of (131)I-3F8 therapy. Successful rerouting of CSF flow for the purpose of therapeutic radioisotope administration is possible. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy can be considered in patients with programmable shunting devices; normal or slit ventricles do not preclude successful ETV.",Kim K;Heather J HJ;Cheryl C;Jeffrey P JP
22379189,HDM2 promotes WIP1-mediated medulloblastoma growth.,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant childhood brain tumor. The protein phosphatase and oncogene WIP1 is over-expressed or amplified in a significant number of primary human medulloblastomas and cell lines. In the present study, we examine an important mechanism by which WIP1 promotes medulloblastoma growth using in vitro and in vivo models. Human cell lines and intracerebellar xenografted animal models were used to study the role of WIP1 and the major TP53 regulator, HDM2, in medulloblastoma growth. Stable expression of WIP1 enhances growth of TP53 wild-type medulloblastoma cells, compared with cells with stable expression of an empty-vector or mutant WIP1. In an animal model, WIP1 enhances proliferation and reduces the survival of immunodeficient mice bearing intracerebellar xenografted human medulloblastoma cells. Cells with increased WIP1 expression also exhibit increased expression of HDM2. HDM2 knockdown or treatment with the HDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3a, the active enantomer of Nutlin-3, specifically inhibits the growth of medulloblastoma cells with increased WIP1 expression. Nutlin-3a does not affect growth of medulloblastoma cells with stable expression of an empty vector or of mutant WIP1. Knockdown of WIP1 or treatment with the WIP1 inhibitor CCT007093 results in increased phosphorylation of known WIP1 targets, reduced HDM2 expression, and reduced growth specifically in WIP1 wild-type and high-expressing medulloblastoma cells. Combined WIP1 and HDM2 inhibition is more effective than WIP1 inhibition alone in blocking growth of WIP1 high-expressing medulloblastoma cells. Our preclinical study supports a role for therapies that target WIP1 and HDM2 in the treatment of medulloblastoma.",Meghan C MC;Tracy-Ann TA;Matthew J MJ;Khanjan K;Robert C RC

However, since Nestin is expressed in all kinds of neural precursors, these data do not allow conclusions to be drawn about the role of β1-integrins in distinct neuronal and glial cell types. By generating conditional knockout mice using granule cell-specific Math1-promoter sequences, we show here that the expression of β1-integrins in granule neurons is dispensable for the development of the cerebellum. Also, deletion of β1-integrin from tumors that arise in a mouse model of granule cell precursor-derived medulloblastoma did not result in a significant survival benefit. Last, expression levels of β1-integrin in human medulloblastoma samples did not predict patient's outcome. However, a β1-integrin knockout using hGFAP-promoter sequences led to cerebellar hypoplasia, inappropriate positioning of Bergmann glia cells in the molecular layer, undirected outgrowth of radial glia fibers, and granule cell ectopia. We therefore conclude that β1-integrin expression in cerebellar granule neurons is not essential during normal development or medulloblastoma formation. In fact, it is the expression of β1-integrin in glia that is crucial for the proper development of the cerebellar cortex.",Alexandra A;Daniel D;Felix F;Julia J;Markus M;Pierfrancesco P;André O AO;Aurelia A;Jörg-Christian JC;Jochen J;Stefan S;Hans A HA;Ulrich U
22362285,Molecular targeting therapy against promyelocytic leukemia protein using arsenic acids in experimental intracranial medulloblastoma.,"Our previous study using human Daoy medulloblastoma cells showed that the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene was significantly upregulated (2.5-fold) in cells positive to prominin-1 antigen (CD133), a possible marker for cancer initiating cells. Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) is known to degrade PML protein and has been used for the treatment of patients with acute PML. In the present study, the effect of PML targeting therapy with As(2)O(3) and cytarabine (Ara-C) on Daoy medulloblastoma cell proliferation was investigated. Daoy cells were pretreated with As(2)O(3) for 6 weeks. The As(2)O(3)-pretreated Daoy cells were cultured in medium containing Ara-C and cell viability was examined. Next, the As(2)O(3)-pretreated Daoy cells were inoculated into the nude mouse brain and the effect of Ara-C on the tumor size was evaluated. A significant increase in chemosensitivity to Ara-C was observed in the As(2)O(3)-pretreated Daoy cells in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. PML and CCND1 (cyclin D1) protein expression of Daoy medulloblastoma cells was downregulated by As(2)O(3) treatment. PML has been proposed as a novel therapeutic target to eradicate quiescent leukemia-initiating cells, and PML-expressing CD133-positive cells are similarly a potential therapeutic target of treatment for medulloblastoma.",Chunyu C;Naoki N;Yun Y;Shinji S;Shinichiro S;Tsutomu T;Hiroki H
22359291,The epigenetics of brain tumors.,"Glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and ependymoma represent molecularly and clinically diverse forms of adult and pediatric brain tumors. While each tumor displays genetic, transcriptional, and cytogenetic heterogeneity, the epigenome of these tumors has only recently emerged as a major field of interest. Here, we describe advances in our understanding of the epigenetics of brain tumors, focusing on DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNA deregulation which contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases.",Adrian M AM;Stephen S;Alexander A;Paul A PA;Michael D MD
22358458,Subgroup-specific alternative splicing in medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma comprises four distinct molecular variants: WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4. We analyzed alternative splicing usage in 14 normal cerebellar samples and 103 medulloblastomas of known subgroup. Medulloblastoma samples have a statistically significant increase in alternative splicing as compared to normal fetal cerebella (2.3-times; P < 6.47E-8). Splicing patterns are distinct and specific between molecular subgroups. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of alternative splicing events accurately assigns medulloblastomas to their correct subgroup. Subgroup-specific splicing and alternative promoter usage was most prevalent in Group 3 (19.4%) and SHH (16.2%) medulloblastomas, while observed less frequently in WNT (3.2%), and Group 4 (9.3%) tumors. Functional annotation of alternatively spliced genes reveals overrepresentation of genes important for neuronal development. Alternative splicing events in medulloblastoma may be regulated in part by the correlative expression of antisense transcripts, suggesting a possible mechanism affecting subgroup-specific alternative splicing. Our results identify additional candidate markers for medulloblastoma subgroup affiliation, further support the existence of distinct subgroups of the disease, and demonstrate an additional level of transcriptional heterogeneity between medulloblastoma subgroups.",Adrian M AM;A Sorana AS;Nanne K NK;Paul A PA;Emily Py EP;David D;John J;Wieslawa W;Timothy T;Charles G CG;Stefan S;Marco A MA;William A WA;Stephen W SW;James T JT;Pim J PJ;Michael D MD
22358457,"Molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma: an international meta-analysis of transcriptome, genetic aberrations, and clinical data of WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4 medulloblastomas.","Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in childhood. Molecular studies from several groups around the world demonstrated that medulloblastoma is not one disease but comprises a collection of distinct molecular subgroups. However, all these studies reported on different numbers of subgroups. The current consensus is that there are only four core subgroups, which should be termed WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4. Based on this, we performed a meta-analysis of all molecular and clinical data of 550 medulloblastomas brought together from seven independent studies. All cases were analyzed by gene expression profiling and for most cases SNP or array-CGH data were available. Data are presented for all medulloblastomas together and for each subgroup separately. For validation purposes, we compared the results of this meta-analysis with another large medulloblastoma cohort (n = 402) for which subgroup information was obtained by immunohistochemistry. Results from both cohorts are highly similar and show how distinct the molecular subtypes are with respect to their transcriptome, DNA copy-number aberrations, demographics, and survival. Results from these analyses will form the basis for prospective multi-center studies and will have an impact on how the different subgroups of medulloblastoma will be treated in the future.",Marcel M;Andrey A;Marc M;David T W DT;Maria M;Paul A PA;Yoon-Jae YJ;Jan J;Antoinette A;Dannis D;Steven C SC;Torsten T;Andre O AO;Stefan S;Martin M;V Peter VP;Magnus L ML;Christine C;Franck F;Olivier O;Francois F;David W DW;Richard J RJ;Scott L SL;Michael D MD;Peter P;Stefan M SM
22350379,Long-term results of combined preradiation chemotherapy and age-tailored radiotherapy doses for childhood medulloblastoma.,"To reduce the sequelae of craniospinal irradiation (CSI) in children under 10 (≥3) years old and to improve the prognosis for high-risk medulloblastoma in adolescents, we adjusted postoperative chemotherapy and CSI doses to patients' stage and age. From 1986 to 1995, 73 patients entered the study. Children under 10 and adolescents with metastases, residual disease (RD) or stage >T3 received postoperative IV vincristine and high-dose (HD) ± intrathecal (IT) methotrexate, while standard-risk adolescents were given IV vincristine and IT methotrexate. Chemotherapy was followed by CSI (19.8 Gy for children <10; 36 Gy for adolescents), with a 54-Gy posterior fossa boost. Maintenance chemotherapy with lomustine and vincristine was administered for a year afterwards. A total of 39 children were under 10 of whom 20 had metastases. Response to chemotherapy was recorded in 70%, but 5-year EFS and OS were only 48 and 56%, respectively. Results were significantly worse for metastatic cases, patients under 10, those with RD, and those staged without MRI (unavailable early in the study). Efforts to preserve survivors' quality of life did not pay off, and most patients over 30 still depended on their parents' income and had severe cognitive/endocrine disabilities. In conclusion, despite a very high response rate with this preradiation HD methotrexate schedule, the outcome for high-risk medulloblastoma patients did not improve (especially when lower CSI doses were used) and patients still developed severe morbidities.",Maura M;Graziella G;Daria D;Veronica V;Filippo F;Emilia E;Geraldina G;Paola P;Bianca B;Laura L;Paolo P;Ettore E;Michela M;Andrea A;Roberto R;Daniela D;Monica M;Federica F;Carlo Alfredo CA;Elisabetta E;Fabio F;Cristina C;Serena S;Marta M;Lorenza L
22349907,Sonic hedgehog-associated medulloblastoma arising from the cochlear nuclei of the brainstem.,"Medulloblastoma is a malignant brain tumor of childhood that comprises at least four molecularly distinct subgroups. We have previously described that cerebellar granule neuron precursors may give rise to the subgroup with a molecular fingerprint of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Other recent data indicate that precursor cells within the dorsal brain stem may serve as cellular origins for Wnt-associated medulloblastomas. To see whether Shh-associated medulloblastomas are also able to develop in the dorsal brainstem, we analyzed two lines of transgenic mice with constitutive Shh signaling in hGFAP- and Math1-positive brainstem precursor populations, respectively. Our results show that in both of these lines, medulloblastomas arise from granule neuron precursors of the cochlear nuclei, a derivative of the auditory lower rhombic lip. This region is distinct from derivatives of precerebellar lower rhombic lip where medulloblastomas arise in mice with constitutive-active Wnt signaling. With respect to their histology and the expression of appropriate markers, Shh tumors from the murine cochlear nuclei perfectly resemble human Shh-associated medulloblastomas. Moreover, we find that in a series of 63 human desmoplastic medulloblastomas, 21 (33%) have a very close contact to the cochlear nuclei on MR imaging. In conclusion, we demonstrate that precursors of the murine rhombic lip, which either develop into cerebellar or into cochlear granule neurons, may give rise to Shh-associated medulloblastoma, and this has important implications for the cellular origin of human medulloblastomas.",Daniel D;Monika M;André O AO;Marcel M;Torsten T;Hans A HA;David H DH;Stefan S;Stefan M SM;Ulrich U

22343890,Clonal selection drives genetic divergence of metastatic medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour, arises in the cerebellum and disseminates through the cerebrospinal fluid in the leptomeningeal space to coat the brain and spinal cord. Dissemination, a marker of poor prognosis, is found in up to 40% of children at diagnosis and in most children at the time of recurrence. Affected children therefore are treated with radiation to the entire developing brain and spinal cord, followed by high-dose chemotherapy, with the ensuing deleterious effects on the developing nervous system. The mechanisms of dissemination through the cerebrospinal fluid are poorly studied, and medulloblastoma metastases have been assumed to be biologically similar to the primary tumour. Here we show that in both mouse and human medulloblastoma, the metastases from an individual are extremely similar to each other but are divergent from the matched primary tumour. Clonal genetic events in the metastases can be demonstrated in a restricted subclone of the primary tumour, suggesting that only rare cells within the primary tumour have the ability to metastasize. Failure to account for the bicompartmental nature of metastatic medulloblastoma could be a major barrier to the development of effective targeted therapies.",Xiaochong X;Paul A PA;Adrian A;Adam J AJ;David J H DJ;Hendrik H;Sidney S;Eric E;Daniel W DW;Charles G CG;Livia L;Timothy T;David D;Nada N;Jeremy J;Jacek J;Todd E TE;Stefan M SM;Andrey A;Xiao-Nan XN;Stephen W SW;Yoon-Jae YJ;Keiko K;Tobey J TJ;Jan J;Martin G MG;Aaron L AL;V Peter VP;William A WA;David A DA;Lara S LS;Michael D MD
22343310,MDM2 antagonism by nutlin-3 induces death in human medulloblastoma cells.,"A critical component of the cellular stress response, the p53 tumor suppressor protein must be functional for many cancer therapies to be effective. Adjuvant therapies that augment p53 function are predicted to sensitize tumor cells to cancer therapies that rely upon p53 for their efficacy. Of those strategies currently being explored to enhance p53 function, inhibition of the ubiquitin ligase, MDM2, a negative regulator of p53, has shown promise. Here, we investigated whether MDM2 antagonism might be effective in inducing cell death in human medulloblastoma (MB) cells. Nutlin-3, a small-molecule inhibitor of MDM2, potently induced apoptosis in MB cells with wild-type TP53. Moreover, nutlin-3 potentiated p53 activation and growth impairment of MB cells in combination with the classic DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin. Together, these results support the concept that MDM2 antagonists may be therapeutically beneficial for patients with MB tumors.",Sara S;Susan M SM
22342098,Early clinical outcomes demonstrate preserved cognitive function in children with average-risk medulloblastoma when treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy.,"To report on acute toxicity, longitudinal cognitive function, and early clinical outcomes in children with average-risk medulloblastoma. Twenty children ≥ 5 years of age classified as having average-risk medulloblastoma were accrued on a prospective protocol of hyperfractionated radiation therapy (HFRT) alone. Radiotherapy was delivered with two daily fractions (1 Gy/fraction, 6 to 8 hours apart, 5 days/week), initially to the neuraxis (36 Gy/36 fractions), followed by conformal tumor bed boost (32 Gy/32 fractions) for a total tumor bed dose of 68 Gy/68 fractions over 6 to 7 weeks. Cognitive function was prospectively assessed longitudinally (pretreatment and at specified posttreatment follow-up visits) with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children to give verbal quotient, performance quotient, and full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ). The median age of the study cohort was 8 years (range, 5-14 years), representing a slightly older cohort. Acute hematologic toxicity was mild and self-limiting. Eight (40%) children had subnormal intelligence (FSIQ <85), including 3 (15%) with mild mental retardation (FSIQ 56-70) even before radiotherapy. Cognitive functioning for all tested domains was preserved in children evaluable at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after completion of HFRT, with no significant decline over time. Age at diagnosis or baseline FSIQ did not have a significant impact on longitudinal cognitive function. At a median follow-up time of 33 months (range, 16-58 months), 3 patients had died (2 of relapse and 1 of accidental burns), resulting in 3-year relapse-free survival and overall survival of 83.5% and 83.2%, respectively. HFRT without upfront chemotherapy has an acceptable acute toxicity profile, without an unduly increased risk of relapse, with preserved cognitive functioning in children with average-risk medulloblastoma.",Tejpal T;Rakesh R;Savita S;Vimoj V;Aliasgar A;Sridhar S;Rajiv R
22340591,A mouse model of the most aggressive subgroup of human medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastomas that display a large cell/anaplastic morphology and overexpress the cellular c-MYC gene are highly aggressive and carry a very poor prognosis. This so-called MYC-subgroup differs in its histopathology, gene expression profile, and clinical behavior from other forms of medulloblastoma. We generated a mouse model of MYC-subgroup medulloblastoma by transducing Trp53-null cerebellar progenitor cells with Myc. The cardinal features of these mouse medulloblastomas closely mimic those of human MYC-subgroup tumors and significantly differ from mouse models of the Sonic-Hedgehog- and WNT-disease subgroups. This mouse model should significantly accelerate understanding and treatment of the most aggressive form of medulloblastoma and infers distinct roles for MYC and MYCN in tumorigenesis.",Daisuke D;Giles G;Tamar T;Paul P;Jerold J;Cuilan C;David D;Chunxu C;Stanley S;David W DW;Richard J RJ;Martine F MF
22340590,An animal model of MYC-driven medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Patients whose tumors exhibit overexpression or amplification of the MYC oncogene (c-MYC) usually have an extremely poor prognosis, but there are no animal models of this subtype of the disease. Here, we show that cerebellar stem cells expressing Myc and mutant Trp53 (p53) generate aggressive tumors following orthotopic transplantation. These tumors consist of large, pleiomorphic cells and resemble human MYC-driven MB at a molecular level. Notably, antagonists of PI3K/mTOR signaling, but not Hedgehog signaling, inhibit growth of tumor cells. These findings suggest that cerebellar stem cells can give rise to MYC-driven MB and identify a novel model that can be used to test therapies for this devastating disease.",Yanxin Y;Colin E CE;Jun J;Alok K AK;Alexey A;Yoon-Jae YJ;Hendrik H;Andrey A;Tracy-Ann TA;Julia L JL;Earlene M EM;C Ryan CR;Anne F AF;Roger E RE;Thomas F TF;Paul A PA;Michael D MD;Stefan M SM;Phillip G PG;Robert J RJ

22339792,Sendai virus-based liposomes enable targeted cytosolic delivery of nanoparticles in brain tumor-derived cells.,"Nanotechnology-based bioassays that detect the presence and/or absence of a combination of cell markers are increasingly used to identify stem or progenitor cells, assess cell heterogeneity, and evaluate tumor malignancy and/or chemoresistance. Delivery methods that enable nanoparticles to rapidly detect emerging, intracellular markers within cell clusters of biopsies will greatly aid in tumor characterization, analysis of functional state and development of treatment regimens. Experiments utilized the Sendai virus to achieve in vitro, cytosolic delivery of Quantum dots in cells cultured from Human brain tumors. Using fluorescence microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy, in vitro experiments illustrated that these virus-based liposomes decreased the amount of non-specifically endocytosed nanoparticles by 50% in the Human glioblastoma and medulloblastoma samples studied. Significantly, virus-based liposome delivery also facilitated targeted binding of Quantum dots to cytosolic Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor within cultured cells, focal to the early detection and characterization of malignant brain tumors. These findings are the first to utilize the Sendai virus to achieve cytosolic, targeted intracellular binding of Qdots within Human brain tumor cells. The results are significant to the continued applicability of nanoparticles used for the molecular labeling of cancer cells to determine tumor heterogeneity, grade, and chemotherapeutic resistivity.",Veronica V;Veronica V;Maribel M

22322278,Distinct patterns of human medulloblastoma dissemination in the developing chick embryo nervous system.,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in children. Aggressive tumors that disseminate along the leptomeninges carry extremely poor prognoses. Mechanisms that predict dissemination are poorly understood. Our objective was to develop a reliable and reproducible model to study MB dissemination. We have created a chicken-human xenograft to study features of MB with leptomeningeal dissemination. Human MB cell lines (D283, Daoy), primary human MB cells (SF8113), and primary genetic mouse model (Math1cre:SmoM2 flox/flox) MB cells were either transfected to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) or were labeled with a membrane permeable green fluorescent probe. Cells were then injected as aggregates or implanted as pellets into the developing chicken brain immediately after neural tube closure at embryonic day 2 (E2). Most embryos were harvested three days after implantation (E5) though some were harvested up to E15. The developing brain was analyzed via whole mount fluorescent imaging and tissue section immunohistochemistry. Human and mouse MBs survived in the developing chicken central nervous system (CNS). They exhibited distinct patterns of incorporation and dissemination into the CNS that were consistent with observed phenotypes of the corresponding human patient or mouse host. Specifically, metastatic D283 cells disseminated along the leptomeninges whereas Daoy, primary mouse MB, and primary human MB cells did not. This work supports an avian-human xenograft as a successful model to study patterns of MB dissemination. Our model provides a basis for manipulating cell signaling mechanisms to understand critical targets involved in MB dissemination.",Tene A TA;Jonathan D JD;Sharon R SR;Arturo A;Nalin N;Jeanette J
22319498,Aldo-Keto Reductase 1B10 and Its Role in Proliferation Capacity of Drug-Resistant Cancers.,"The human aldo-keto reductase AKR1B10, originally identified as an aldose reductase-like protein and human small intestine aldose reductase, is a cytosolic NADPH-dependent reductase that metabolizes a variety of endogenous compounds, such as aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes and dicarbonyl compounds, and some drug ketones. The enzyme is highly expressed in solid tumors of several tissues including lung and liver, and as such has received considerable interest as a relevant biomarker for the development of those tumors. In addition, AKR1B10 has been recently reported to be significantly up-regulated in some cancer cell lines (medulloblastoma D341 and colon cancer HT29) acquiring resistance toward chemotherapeutic agents (cyclophosphamide and mitomycin c), suggesting the validity of the enzyme as a chemoresistance marker. Although the detailed information on the AKR1B10-mediated mechanisms leading to the drug resistance process is not well understood so far, the enzyme has been proposed to be involved in functional regulations of cell proliferation and metabolism of drugs and endogenous lipids during the development of chemoresistance. This article reviews the current literature focusing mainly on expression profile and roles of AKR1B10 in the drug resistance of cancer cells. Recent developments of AKR1B10 inhibitors and their usefulness in restoring sensitivity to anticancer drugs are also reviewed.",Toshiyuki T;Yasuhiro Y;Satoshi S;Midori M;Ossama O;Akira A
22315164,Matching mice to malignancy: molecular subgroups and models of medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma, the largest group of embryonal brain tumors, has historically been classified into five variants based on histopathology. More recently, epigenetic and transcriptional analyses of primary tumors have subclassified medulloblastoma into four to six subgroups, most of which are incongruous with histopathological classification. Improved stratification is required for prognosis and development of targeted treatment strategies, to maximize cure and minimize adverse effects. Several mouse models of medulloblastoma have contributed both to an improved understanding of progression and to developmental therapeutics. In this review, we summarize the classification of human medulloblastoma subtypes based on histopathology and molecular features. We describe existing genetically engineered mouse models, compare these to human disease, and discuss the utility of mouse models for developmental therapeutics. Just as accurate knowledge of the correct molecular subtype of medulloblastoma is critical to the development of targeted therapy in patients, we propose that accurate modeling of each subtype of medulloblastoma in mice will be necessary for preclinical evaluation and optimization of those targeted therapies.",Jasmine J;Christin C;Shirley L SL;Michael D MD;Robert J RJ;William A WA
22313687,Enhancing CHK1 inhibitor lethality in glioblastoma.,"The present studies were initiated to determine whether inhibitors of MEK1/2 or SRC signaling, respectively, enhance CHK1 inhibitor lethality in primary human glioblastoma cells. Multiple MEK1/2 inhibitors (CI-1040 (PD184352); AZD6244 (ARRY-142886)) interacted with multiple CHK1 inhibitors (UCN-01, AZD7762) to kill multiple primary human glioma cell isolates that have a diverse set of genetic alterations typically found in the disease. Inhibition of SRC family proteins also enhanced CHK1 inhibitor lethality. Combined treatment of glioma cells with (MEK1/2 + CHK1) inhibitors enhanced radiosensitivity. Combined (MEK1/2 + CHK1) inhibitor treatment led to dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and S6 ribosomal protein, whereas the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 was increased. MEK1/2 + CHK1 inhibitor-stimulated cell death was associated with the cleavage of pro-caspases 3 and 7 as well as the caspase substrate (PARP). We also observed activation of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 effector proteins BAK and BAX and reduced levels of pro-survival BCL-2 family protein BCL-XL. Overexpression of BCL-XL alleviated but did not completely abolish MEK1/2 + CHK1 inhibitor cytotoxicity in GBM cells. These findings argue that multiple inhibitors of the SRC-MEK pathway have the potential to interact with multiple CHK1 inhibitors to kill glioma cells.",Yong Y;Yun Y;Steven S;Paul P
22313685,"Histone deacetylase inhibitor-mediated sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in childhood malignancies is not associated with upregulation of TRAIL receptor expression, but with potentiated caspase-8 activation.","Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has great potential for the treatment of cancer because it targets tumor cells while sparing normal cells. Several cancers, however, fail to respond to TRAIL's antineoplastic effects. These resistant tumors require cotreatment with sensitizing agents in order for TRAIL to exert anticancer activity. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been recognized as potent TRAIL sensitizers. In searching for the determinants of TRAIL responsiveness, HDACi-mediated TRAIL sensitization has been predominantly attributed to TRAIL receptor upregulation. This explanation, however, has been challenged by a few studies. The aim of the present study was to explore the relevance of TRAIL receptor expression for HDACi-mediated TRAIL sensitization in childhood tumors, i.e., in medulloblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma and osteosarcoma. In previous studies, we had shown that TRAIL and HDACi were synergistic in inducing apoptosis in medulloblastoma and Ewing's sarcoma. In the present study, we demonstrate that HDACi cooperated with TRAIL in eliciting cell death in osteosarcoma. However, HDACi treatment did not alter or even reduced cell surface expression of TRAIL receptors in the three childhood tumors. In gaining insight into the apoptotic pathway involved in TRAIL sensitization, HDACi were found to potentiate TRAIL-induced caspase-8 activation. Taken together, our findings suggest that HDACi-mediated TRAIL sensitization is not the result of TRAIL receptor upregulation, but the result of a receptor-proximal event in childhood tumor cells.",Jürgen J;Navina N;Sabine S;Susan S;Désirée D;Chithra D CD;James F JF
22313636,"Bortezomib induces apoptosis and growth suppression in human medulloblastoma cells, associated with inhibition of AKT and NF-ĸB signaling, and synergizes with an ERK inhibitor.","Medulloblastoma is the most common brain tumor in children. Here, we report that bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in two established cell lines and a primary culture of human medulloblastomas. Bortezomib increased the release of cytochrome c to cytosol and activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, resulting in cleavage of PARP. Caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) could rescue medulloblastoma cells from the cytotoxicity of bortezomib. Phosphorylation of AKT and its upstream regulator mTOR were reduced by bortezomib treatment in medulloblastoma cells. Bortezomib increased the expression of Bad and Bak, pro-apoptotic proteins, and p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, negative regulators of cell cycle progression, which are associated with the growth suppression and induction of apoptosis in these tumor cells. Bortezomib also increased the accumulation of phosphorylated IĸBα, and decreased nuclear translocation of NF-ĸB. Thus, NF-ĸB signaling and activation of its downstream targets are suppressed. Moreover, ERK inhibitors or downregulating ERK with ERK siRNA synergized with bortezomib on anticancer effects in medulloblastoma cells. Bortezomib also inhibited the growth of human medulloblastoma cells in a mouse xenograft model. These findings suggest that proteasome inhibitors are potentially promising drugs for treatment of pediatric medulloblastomas.",Fan F;Veronica V;Shirley S;Michael M;Lucy L;Ralf R;Yan Y;Anna A;Wei W;M L Richard ML;Timothy T;Yun Y;Richard R
22312539,Metastatic Medulloblastoma in Childhood: Chang's Classification Revisited.,"Purpose. To correlate the radiological aspects of metastases, the response to chemotherapy, and patient outcome in disseminated childhood medulloblastoma. Patients and Methods. This population-based study concerned 117 newly diagnosed children with disseminated medulloblastoma treated at the Institute Gustave Roussy between 1988 and 2008. Metastatic disease was assessed using the Chang staging system, their form (positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), nodular or laminar), and their extension (positive cerebrospinal fluid, local, extensive). All patients received preirradiation chemotherapy. Results. The overall survival did not differ according to Chang M-stage. The 5-year overall survival was 59% in patients with nodular metastases compared to 35% in those with laminar metastases. The 5-year overall survival was 76% in patients without disease at the end of pre-irradiation chemotherapy compared to 34% in those without a complete response (P = 0.0008). Conclusions. Radiological characteristics of metastases correlated with survival in patients with medulloblastoma. Complete response to sandwich chemotherapy was a strong predictor of survival.",Christelle C;Annick A;Barry B;Julie J;Marie-Stephanie MS;Aurelie A;Dominique D;Agnes A;Chantal C;Jacques J
22311706,The aryl hydrocarbon receptor contributes to the proliferation of human medulloblastoma cells.,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)/PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) transcription superfamily, is known to regulate the toxicity of polyaromatic halogenated hydrocarbon environmental chemicals, most notably dioxin. However, the AhR has also been implicated in multiple stages of tumorigenesis. Medulloblastoma (MB), a primary cerebellar brain tumor arising in infants and children, is thought to originate from abnormally proliferating cerebellar granule neuron precursors (GNPs). GNPs express high levels of the AhR in the external germinal layer of the developing cerebellum. Moreover, our laboratory has previously reported that either abnormal activation or deletion of the AhR leads to dysregulation of GNP cell cycle activity and maturation. These observations led to the hypothesis that the AhR promotes the growth of MB. Therefore, this study evaluated whether the AhR serves a pro-proliferative role in an immortalized MB tumor cell line (DAOY). We produced a stable AhR knockdown DAOY cell line [AhR short hairpin RNA (shRNA)], which exhibited a 70% reduction in AhR protein levels. Compared with wild-type DAOY cells, AhR shRNA DAOY cells displayed an impaired G(1)-to-S cell cycle transition, decreased DNA synthesis, and reduced proliferation. Furthermore, these cell cycle perturbations were correlated with decreased levels of the pro-proliferative gene Hes1 and increased levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p27(kip1). Supplementation experiments with human AhR restored the proliferative activity in AhR shRNA DAOY cells. Taken together, our data show that the AhR promotes proliferation of MB cells, suggesting that this pathway should be considered as a potential therapeutic target for MB treatment.",Daniel P DP;Lisa A LA
22307474,Oncolytic measles virus prolongs survival in a murine model of cerebral spinal fluid-disseminated medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. Although the survival rate of afflicted children has improved considerably over the past several years, a subset of these patients will present with disseminated disease and face a much bleaker prognosis. In addition, patients may present with disseminated disease at recurrence. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of a recombinant oncolytic measles virus (MV) to treat localized medulloblastoma in a mouse xenograft model. In the present study, we sought to extend our findings to the treatment of disseminated disease. To this end, we developed and characterized a mouse xenograft model of disseminated medulloblastoma using serial bioluminescent imaging techniques in combination with histopathological examination. Mice injected with medulloblastoma cells into their right lateral ventricle showed tumor growth in their ventricles and in both intracranial and spinal subarachnoid spaces, closely recapitulating the human disease. Subsequent intraventricular administration of MV resulted in stabilization and shrinkage of the tumor, significantly prolonging the survival of the treated animals, compared with those treated with an inactivated virus. These data demonstrate that oncolytic MV may be of use in treating disseminated medulloblastoma. In addition, our protocol of intraventricular tumor cell injection, followed by bioluminescent imaging coupled with histopathological examination, provides a model for use in evaluating future recombinant oncolytic viruses and other preclinical therapeutic approaches for disseminated medulloblastoma.",Adam W AW;Brian B;Christopher R CR;Stephen J SJ;Evanthia E;Corey C
22304788,"Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule is expressed in neuroepithelial neoplasms and decreases with tumor malignancy, matrix metalloproteinase 2 expression, and absence of IDH1R132H mutation.","Diffuse growth of gliomas is based on enhanced cell migration and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases in gliomas is associated with a poor prognosis. The activated leukocyte adhesion molecule is considered to be indispensable for conversion of matrix metalloproteinase 2 into its active form. We therefore investigated the expression of activated leukocyte adhesion molecule in 9 malignant glial cell lines, 105 normal/reactive human brain specimens, 248 astrocytomas/glioblastomas, 98 ependymomas, 35 oligodendrogliomas, 10 neurocytomas, 10 primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), and 36 medulloblastomas by immunohistochemistry and in selected cases by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Correlation between activated leukocyte adhesion molecule expression and tumor grades and entities, proliferation activity, matrix metalloproteinase 2 expression, prognostic isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1 mutation (R132H) status, O-6-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter status, or association with patient survival were analyzed. All oligodendrogliomas were strongly activated leukocyte adhesion molecule positive. Numbers of activated leukocyte adhesion molecule positive tumors were higher in glioblastomas (93%) than in diffuse astrocytomas (83%), but mean expression intensity was significantly reduced. Anaplastic ependymomas (68%) exhibited reduced numbers of activated leukocyte adhesion molecule-positive tumors and staining intensity compared with lower-grade ependymomas (85%). Activated leukocyte adhesion molecule expression in gliomas was independent of proliferative activity, MGMT status, patient survival, and age, whereas gliomas with IDH1 (R132H) mutation had significantly higher activated leukocyte adhesion molecule levels than their wild-type counterparts. Matrix metalloproteinase 2-negative glioblastomas exhibited significantly reduced activated leukocyte adhesion molecule expression levels compared with astrocytomas. In summary, our findings indicate that activated leukocyte adhesion molecule expression levels in gliomas are probably linked to other mechanisms than its supposed role as regulator of matrix metalloproteinase 2.",Olga O;Katrin K;Michel M;Johannes J;Richard R;Marcos M;Jens J
22302101,An essential role for p38 MAPK in cerebellar granule neuron precursor proliferation.,"Development of the cerebellum occurs postnatally and is marked by a rapid proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNPs). CGNPs are the cells of origin for SHH-driven medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Here, we investigated the role of ERK, JNK, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases in CGNP proliferation. We found high levels of p38α in proliferating CGNPs. Concomitantly, members of the p38 pathway, such as ASK1, MKK3 and ATF-2, were also elevated. Inhibition of the Shh pathway or CGNP proliferation blunts p38α levels, irrespective of Shh treatment. Strikingly, p38α levels were high in vivo in the external granule layer of the postnatal cerebellum, Shh-dependent mouse medulloblastomas and human medulloblastomas of the SHH subtype. Finally, knocking down p38α by short hairpin RNA-carrying lentiviruses as well as the pharmacologically inhibiting of its kinase activity caused a marked decrease in CGNP proliferation, underscoring its requirement for Shh-dependent proliferation in CGNPs. The inhibition of p38α also caused a decrease in Gli1 and N-myc transcript levels, consistent with reduced proliferation. These findings suggest p38 inhibition as a potential way to increase the efficacy of treatments available for malignancies associated with deregulated SHH signaling, such as basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma.",Cemile G CG;Adiba A;Andrey A;Massimo M;Aashir A;Lori A LA;Bipin B;Susana R SR;Zaher Z;Stefan S;Anna M AM
22294272,Brain tumors in children--current therapies and newer directions.,"Brain tumors are the second most common malignancy and the major cause of cancer related mortality in children. Though significant advances in neuroimaging, neurosurgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy have evolved over the years, overall survival rate remains less than 75%. Malignant gliomas, high risk medulloblastoma with recurrence and infant brain tumors continue to be a major cause of therapeutic frustration. Even today diffuse pontine gliomas are universally fatal. Though tumors like low grade glioma have an overall excellent survival, recurrences and progression in eloquent areas pose therapeutic challenges. As research continues to unravel the biology including key molecules and signaling pathways responsible for the oncogenesis of different childhood brain tumors, novel targeted therapies are profiled. Identification of major targets like the Epidermal Growth factor Receptor (EGFR), Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGFR), Vascular Endothelial Growth factor (VEGF) and key signaling pathways like the MAPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR has enabled us over the recent years to better understand tumor behavior and design tailored therapy. These efforts have improved overall survival of children with brain tumors. This review article discusses the current status of common brain tumors in children and the newer therapeutic approaches.",Soumen S;Zsila Sousan ZS;Michael L ML;Sunil S;Tribhawan S TS
22287205,Targeting the enhancer of zeste homologue 2 in medulloblastoma.,"Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 2 that catalyzes the trimethylation of histone H3 on Lys 27, and represses gene transcription. EZH2 enhances cancer-cell proliferation and regulates stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that EZH2 is highly expressed in medulloblastoma, a highly malignant brain tumor of childhood, and this altered expression is correlated with genomic gain of chromosome 7 in a subset of medulloblastoma. Inhibition of EZH2 by RNAi suppresses medulloblastoma tumor cell growth. We show that 3-deazaneplanocin A, a chemical inhibitor of EZH2, can suppress medulloblastoma cell growth partially by inducing apoptosis. Suppression of EZH2 expression diminishes the ability of tumor cells to form spheres in culture and strongly represses the ability of known oncogenes to transform neural stem cells. These findings establish a role of EZH2 in medulloblastoma and identify EZH2 as a potential therapeutic target especially in high-risk tumors.",Irina I;Sujatha S;Peter P;Victor E VE;Paul A PA;Adrian A;Michael D MD;Nicholas K NK;Rajeev R
22280307,Anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome protein Cdc27 is a target for curcumin-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.,"Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), the yellow pigment in the Asian spice turmeric, is a hydrophobic polyphenol from the rhizome of Curcuma longa. Because of its chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic potential with no discernable side effects, it has become one of the major natural agents being developed for cancer therapy. Accumulating evidence suggests that curcumin induces cell death through activation of apoptotic pathways and inhibition of cell growth and proliferation. The mitotic checkpoint, or spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), is the major cell cycle control mechanism to delay the onset of anaphase during mitosis. One of the key regulators of the SAC is the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) which ubiquitinates cyclin B and securin and targets them for proteolysis. Because APC/C not only ensures cell cycle arrest upon spindle disruption but also promotes cell death in response to prolonged mitotic arrest, it has become an attractive drug target in cancer therapy. Cell cycle profiles were determined in control and curcumin-treated medulloblastoma and various other cancer cell lines. Pull-down assays were used to confirm curcumin binding. APC/C activity was determined using an in vitro APC activity assay. We identified Cdc27/APC3, a component of the APC/C, as a novel molecular target of curcumin and showed that curcumin binds to and crosslinks Cdc27 to affect APC/C function. We further provide evidence that curcumin preferably induces apoptosis in cells expressing phosphorylated Cdc27 usually found in highly proliferating cells. We report that curcumin directly targets the SAC to induce apoptosis preferably in cells with high levels of phosphorylated Cdc27. Our studies provide a possible molecular mechanism why curcumin induces apoptosis preferentially in cancer cells and suggest that phosphorylation of Cdc27 could be used as a biomarker to predict the therapeutic response of cancer cells to curcumin.",Seung Joon SJ;Sigrid A SA
22265402,Genome sequencing of pediatric medulloblastoma links catastrophic DNA rearrangements with TP53 mutations.,"Genomic rearrangements are thought to occur progressively during tumor development. Recent findings, however, suggest an alternative mechanism, involving massive chromosome rearrangements in a one-step catastrophic event termed chromothripsis. We report the whole-genome sequencing-based analysis of a Sonic-Hedgehog medulloblastoma (SHH-MB) brain tumor from a patient with a germline TP53 mutation (Li-Fraumeni syndrome), uncovering massive, complex chromosome rearrangements. Integrating TP53 status with microarray and deep sequencing-based DNA rearrangement data in additional patients reveals a striking association between TP53 mutation and chromothripsis in SHH-MBs. Analysis of additional tumor entities substantiates a link between TP53 mutation and chromothripsis, and indicates a context-specific role for p53 in catastrophic DNA rearrangements. Among these, we observed a strong association between somatic TP53 mutations and chromothripsis in acute myeloid leukemia. These findings connect p53 status and chromothripsis in specific tumor types, providing a genetic basis for understanding particularly aggressive subtypes of cancer.",Tobias T;David T W DT;Marc M;Adrian M AM;Thomas T;Joachim J;Natalie N;Marc M;David D;Paul A PA;Elke E;Jelena J;Qi Q;Luca L;Hendrik H;Sebastian S;Sabrina S;Huriye H;Cynthia C;Christian C;Andreas A;Volkmar V;Benedikt B;Roland R;Wolfram W;Jonathon J;Vladimir V;Andreas E AE;Olaf O;Dianna D;Cindy C;Rinnat R;Diana M DM;Jonathan J;Nada N;Adam A;Lars L;Frank G FG;Konstanze K;Hartmut H;Jan J;Jan J JJ;Rogier R;Marcel M;Uri U;David D;Andrey A;Michael D MD;Peter P;Stefan M SM;Jan O JO
22261078,Auditory-perceptual speech analysis in children with cerebellar tumours: a long-term follow-up study.,"Mutism and Subsequent Dysarthria (MSD) and the Posterior Fossa Syndrome (PFS) have become well-recognized clinical entities which may develop after resection of cerebellar tumours. However, speech characteristics following a period of mutism have not been documented in much detail. This study carried out a perceptual speech analysis in 24 children and adolescents (of whom 12 became mute in the immediate postoperative phase) 1-12.2 years after cerebellar tumour resection. The most prominent speech deficits in this study were distorted vowels, slow rate, voice tremor, and monopitch. Factors influencing long-term speech disturbances are presence or absence of postoperative PFS, the localisation of the surgical lesion and the type of adjuvant treatment. Long-term speech deficits may be present up to 12 years post-surgery. The speech deficits found in children and adolescents with cerebellar lesions following cerebellar tumour surgery do not necessarily resemble adult speech characteristics of ataxic dysarthria.",Hyo Jung HJ;Coriene C;Femke F;Jo J;Peter P;Philippe F PF
22258352,Complete remission and long-term survival in a child with relapsed medulloblastoma with extensive osteosclerotic bony metastasis with a novel metronomic chemobiological approach.,"Extraneural metastases in medulloblastoma are rare. We report a boy with medulloblastoma who was initially treated with gross total excision of primary tumor followed by radiotherapy. Six years later, he developed disseminated osteosclerotic bony relapse associated with bone marrow involvement. He was successfully salvaged with metronomic low-dose cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and zoledronic acid. In patients with medulloblastoma and bone pain, metastases to bone should be excluded, and medulloblastoma should be considered while investigating osteosclerotic bone lesions. Furthermore, metronomic chemotherapy should be considered in this setting until better therapeutic modalities emerge.",Vishal V;Purna P;Rakesh R;Venkatesh V;Epari E;Seema S;Brijesh B
22258034,Vasculogenic mimicry and its clinical significance in medulloblastoma.,"Vasculogenic mimicry (VM), a process involving the formation of a tubular structure by highly invasive and genetically dysregulated tumor cells, can supplement the function of blood vessels to transport nutrients and oxygen to maintain the growth of tumor cells in many malignant tumors. We aimed to explore the existence of VM and its clinical significance in medulloblastoma in this study. VM was identified in 9 out of 41 (22%) medulloblastoma tissues. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the presence of VM was associated with the expression of MMP-2, MMP-14, EphA2 and laminin 5γ2. Tumor tissues with VM were associated with lower microvessel density (MVD), which was indirect evidence of the blood supply function of VM. Survival analysis and log-rank tests showed that patients with VM had shorter overall survival time than those without VM. Multivariate analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model identified VM as independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Our results confirmed the existence of VM for the first time and revealed that VM is a strong independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with medulloblastoma.",Shi-yong SY;Li L;Geng-qiang GQ;Sha S;Xin-lin XL;Zhen-hua ZH;Yi-jing YJ;Xiao-dan XD;Ying-qian YQ;Yi-quan YQ
22253443,Loss of brain-enriched miR-124 microRNA enhances stem-like traits and invasiveness of glioma cells.,"miR-124 is a brain-enriched microRNA that plays a crucial role in neural development and has been shown to be down-regulated in glioma and medulloblastoma, suggesting its possible involvement in brain tumor progression. Here, we show that miR-124 is down-regulated in a panel of different grades of glioma tissues and in all of the human glioma cell lines we examined. By integrated bioinformatics analysis and experimental confirmation, we identified SNAI2, which is often up-regulated in glioma, as a direct functional target of miR-124. Because SNAI2 has been shown to regulate stem cell functions, we examined the roles of miR-124 and SNAI2 in glioma cell stem-like traits. The results showed that overexpression of miR-124 and knockdown of SNAI2 reduced neurosphere formation, CD133(+) cell subpopulation, and stem cell marker (BMI1, Nanog, and Nestin) expression, and these effects could be rescued by re-expression of SNAI2. Furthermore, enhanced miR-124 expression significantly inhibited glioma cell invasion in vitro. Finally, stable overexpression of miR-124 and knockdown of SNAI2 inhibited the tumorigenicity and invasion of glioma cells in vivo. These findings reveal, for the first time, that the tumor suppressor activity of miR-124 could be partly due to its inhibitory effects on glioma stem-like traits and invasiveness through SNAI2.",Hongping H;William K C WKC;Samuel S SS;Xiaochun X;Songshan S;Johnny J;Gilberto K K GKK;Gang G;Danny T M DTM;Xiu-Wu XW;Hsiang-Fu HF;Wai Sang WS;Marie C MC
22249617,Overexpression of HMGA1 deregulates tumor growth via cdc25A and alters migration/invasion through a cdc25A-independent pathway in medulloblastoma.,"Overexpression of high mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1) is common in human cancers. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying its deregulation and downstream targets, and information about its clinical and biological significance in medulloblastoma (MB) is lacking. Here, we demonstrated frequent genomic gain at 6p21.33-6p21.31 with copy number increase leading to overexpression of HMGA1 in MB. The overexpression correlated with a high proliferation index and poor prognosis. Moreover, we found that hsa-miR-124a targeted 3'UTR of HMGA1 and negatively modulated the expression in MB cells, indicating that loss/downregulation of hsa-miR-124a reported in our previous study could contribute to the overexpression. Regarding the biological significance of HMGA1, siRNA knockdown and ectopic expression studies revealed the crucial roles of HMGA1 in controlling MB cell growth and migration/invasion through modulation of apoptosis and formation of filopodia and stress fibers, respectively. Furthermore, we identified cdc25A as a target of HMGA1 and showed that physical interaction between HMGA1 and the cdc25A promoter is required for transcriptional upregulation. In clinical samples, HMGA1 and cdc25A were concordantly overexpressed. Functionally, cdc25A is involved in the HMGA1-mediated control of MB cell growth. Finally, netropsin, which competes with HMGA1 in DNA binding, reduced the expression of cdc25A by suppression of its promoter activity and inhibited in vitro and in vivo intracranial MB cell growth. In conclusion, our results delineate the mechanisms underlying the deregulation and reveal the functional significance of HMGA1 in controlling MB cell growth and migration/invasion. Importantly, the results highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting HMGA1 in MB patients.",Kin-Mang KM;Queeny Kwan Yi QK;Jesse C S JC;Fanny Man-Ting FM;Kay K W KK;Walter Wai WW;Alfred S L AS;Hai H;Nellie Y F NY;Hiu-Ming HM;Liangfu L;Yin Y;Ying Y;Ho-Keung HK
22249380,Inhibition of phosphorylated STAT3 by cucurbitacin I enhances chemoradiosensitivity in medulloblastoma-derived cancer stem cells.,"CD133 (PROM1) is a potential marker for cancer stem cells (CSCs), including those found in brain tumors. Recently, medulloblastoma (MB)-derived CD133-positive cells were found to have CSC-like properties and were proposed to be important contributors to tumorigenicity, cancer progression, and chemoradioresistance. However, the biomolecular pathways and therapeutic targets specific to MB-derived CSCs remain unresolved. In the present study, we isolated CD133(+) cells from MB cell lines and determined that they showed increased tumorigenicity, radioresistance, and higher expression of both embryonic stem cell-related and drug resistance-related genes compared to CD133(-) cells. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the STAT3 pathway might be important in MB and CD133(+) cells. To evaluate the effects of inhibiting the STAT3 pathway, MB-derived CD133(+/-) cells were treated with the potent STAT3 inhibitor, cucurbitacin I. Treatment with cucurbitacin I significantly suppressed the CSC-like properties and stemness gene signature of MB-derived CD133(+) cells. Furthermore, cucurbitacin I treatment increased the apoptotic sensitivity of MB-derived CD133(+) cells to radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs. Notably, cucurbitacin I demonstrated synergistic effects with ionizing radiation to inhibit tumorigenicity in MB-CD133(+)-inoculated mice. These results indicate that the STAT3 pathway plays a key role in mediating CSC properties in MB-derived CD133(+) cells. Targeting STAT3 with cucurbitacin I may therefore represent a novel therapeutic approach for treating malignant brain tumors.",Charn-Jung CJ;Chih-Hung CH;Wen-Shin WS;Shen-Kou SK;Lin-Chung LC;Chin-Hong CH;Shaw-Yeu SY;Ching-Yao CY;Chuan-Chih CC;Hung-Fu HF;Chi-Shuan CS;Ming-Chi MC;Jorn-Hon JH;Kai-Hsi KH

The improvements in outcome have been due to advances in surgical techniques, the wider use of chemotherapy, and the more judicious use of radiotherapy.

22214326,Specific inhibition of the transcription factor Ci by a cobalt(III) Schiff base-DNA conjugate.,"We describe the use of Co(III) Schiff base-DNA conjugates, a versatile class of research tools that target C2H2 transcription factors, to inhibit the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. In developing mammalian embryos, Hh signaling is critical for the formation and development of many tissues and organs. Inappropriate activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway has been implicated in a variety of cancers including medulloblastomas and basal cell carcinomas. It is well-known that Hh regulates the activity of the Gli family of C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors in mammals. In Drosophila the function of the Gli proteins is performed by a single transcription factor with an identical DNA binding consensus sequence, Cubitus Interruptus (Ci). We have demonstrated previously that conjugation of a specific 17 base-pair oligonucleotide to a Co(III) Schiff base complex results in a targeted inhibitor of the Snail family C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors. Modification of the oligonucleotide sequence in the Co(III) Schiff base-DNA conjugate to that of Ci's consensus sequence (Co(III)-Ci) generates an equally selective inhibitor of Ci. Co(III)-Ci irreversibly binds the Ci zinc finger domain and prevents it from binding DNA in vitro. In a Ci responsive tissue culture reporter gene assay, Co(III)-Ci reduces the transcriptional activity of Ci in a concentration dependent manner. In addition, injection of wild-type Drosophila embryos with Co(III)-Ci phenocopies a Ci loss of function phenotype, demonstrating effectiveness in vivo. This study provides evidence that Co(III) Schiff base-DNA conjugates are a versatile class of specific and potent tools for studying zinc finger domain proteins and have potential applications as customizable anticancer therapeutics.",Ryan R RR;Allison S AS;Marie C MC;Robert J RJ;Robert A RA;Thomas J TJ
22213600,In vivo generation of neural tumors from neoplastic pluripotent stem cells models early human pediatric brain tumor formation.,"Recent studies have identified gene signatures in malignant tumors that are associated with human embryonic stem cells, suggesting a molecular relationship between aggressive cancers and pluripotency. Here, we characterize neural precursors (NPs) derived from transformed human embryonic stem cells (N-t-hESCs) that exhibit neoplastic features of human brain tumors. NPs derived from t-hESCs have enhanced cell proliferation and an inability to mature toward the astrocytic lineage, compared with progeny derived from normal human embryonic stem cells (N-hESCs) independent of adherent or neurosphere outgrowth. Intracranial transplantation of NPs derived from N-t-hESCs and N-hESCs into NOD SCID mice revealed development of neuroectoderm tumors exclusively from the N-t-hESCs NPs and not from normal N-hESCs. These tumors infiltrated the ventricles and the cerebellum of recipient mice and displayed morphological, phenotypic, and molecular features associated with classic medulloblastoma including retention of a pluripotent signature. Importantly, N-t-hESCs did not exhibit cytogenetic changes associated with medulloblastoma, suggesting that aberrant cellular and molecular properties precede the acquisition of karyotypic changes thus underscoring the value of this model system of human medulloblastoma. Our study demonstrates that NPs from a starting population of neoplastic human pluripotent parent cells possess brain tumor-initiating cell capacity, thereby providing a model system to investigate initiation and progression of primitive human neural cancers that are difficult to assess using somatic sources.",Tamra E TE;Ludivine Coudière LC;Aline A;Mickie M
22209398,MRI features in children with desmoplastic medulloblastoma.,"Desmoplastic medulloblastoma (DMB) is a variant that has a more favorable prognosis compared to classical medulloblastoma, but its MRI features have not been as well described. We retrospectively reviewed the MRI features in children with pathologically proven DMB, including T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and contrast enhanced images, with isotropic diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI also performed in some patients. There were 16 tumors in 12 patients; one patient had five discrete lesions. In all patients, the tumor involved the cerebellar vermis, with nine lesions showing multiple peripheral small cysts. In nine of 16 tumors, there were focal areas of isointensity or hypointensity on T2-weighted or FLAIR images; seven of these showed corresponding focal enhancement. There was also one patient with radiating star-shaped enhancement in two lesions, and a multi-nodular enhancing pattern was observed in another patient. Low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were found in the lesions studied by DW MRI in five patients. DMB may have a typical imaging appearance of peripheral cysts, decreased ADC and focal enhancing areas corresponding to focal isointense or hypointense signal on T2-weighted and FLAIR images. Although these MRI features may distinguish this variant of medulloblastoma, multinodular or star-shaped radiating enhancement may also be detected in some patients.",Han-Qiu HQ;Xuan X;Yuxin Y;Jiawen J;Yin Y;C C CC;Xiaoyuan X
24451804,Hedgehog Pathway in Pediatric Cancers: They're Not Just for Brain Tumors Anymore.,"The Hedgehog (HH) pathway regulates fundamental processes in embryonic development, including stem cell maintenance, cell differentiation, tissue polarity, and cell proliferation. In the vertebrate pathway, Sonic hedgehog (SHH) binds to Patched1 (PTCH1), which relieves its inhibition of Smoothened (SMO), allowing the GLI family of transcription factors to translocate to the nucleus and activate HH target genes such as GLI1, GLI2, PTCH1, CYCLIN D1, BCL-2, and MYCN. The HH pathway is also an active participant in tumorigenesis. In 1996, loss-of-function mutation in PTCH1 was discovered to be the cause of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS, or Gorlin syndrome), an autosomal dominant disease associated with increased rates of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), medulloblastoma (MB), and rarely, rhabdomyosarcoma. It is now estimated that 100% of sporadic BCC and up to 20% to 30% of MB also harbor activating HH pathway mutations. Together, these discoveries firmly established the linkage between HH pathway activation and cancer development. Intense research has since been focused on further defining the role of the HH pathway in BCC and MB and potential therapeutic strategies to inhibit HH signaling. Early clinical trials of SMO inhibitors have shown promising results in the treatment of adult BCC and SHH-driven MB. More recently, a number of other pediatric cancers have been reported to show HH activity, making these tumors potential candidates for HH inhibitor therapy. To date however, no HH pathway mutations have been identified in other pediatric cancers. This review will describe the HH pathway signaling in development and cancer with a focus on recent evidence for HH pathway activation in central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS pediatric cancers.",Tobey J TJ

23788851,Institutional experience of paediatric high-grade central nervous system tumours: an analysis of 74 patients and review of the literature.,"Although the survival for children with certain central nervous system (CNS) tumour types has improved through current surgical and adjuvant treatment modalities, the prognosis of many high-grade tumours remains poor despite aggressive treatment. The aim of this study is to analyse patients with high-grade brain tumours in our institution to determine the histopathology, clinical characteristics, treatment modalities, and survival. A total of 74 patients with a diagnosis of high-grade brain tumour were analysed. There were a total of 31 patients with embryonal tumours, 27 patients with high-grade glial tumours, 12 patients with brain stem gliomas and 4 patients with other high-grade brain tumours. There were 48 (65%) boys and 26 (35%) girls (ratio: 1.85) with a median age of 99.7 months (range = 2-204 months). The median follow-up period was 19 months (range = 1-204 months). Tumour recurrence was observed in 38 patients (51.4%). The overall survival rate and event-free survival rate of our patients were 27% and 19.5%, respectively. Pediatric high-grade CNS tumours have a very aggressive behaviour and a significant number of children eventually succumb to disease despite multimodal treatment. There is a need of more effective therapeutic approaches for these tumours with poor prognosis. The future improvement in childhood high-grade brain tumour management depends on a better understanding of the molecular genetics and biology of brain tumours.",Faruk Guclu FG;Aynur A;Ceyda C;Arzu A;Avni A;Kemali K;Huseyin H;Aylar A
23788850,Tomotherapy - a different way of dose delivery in radiotherapy.,"Helical tomotherapy is one of the methods of radiotherapy. This method enables treatment implementation for a wide spectrum of clinical cases. The vast array of therapeutic uses of helical tomotherapy results directly from the method of dose delivery, which is significantly different from the classic method developed for conventional linear accelerators. The paper discusses the method of dose delivery by a tomotherapy machine. Moreover, an analysis and presentation of treatment plans was performed in order to show the therapeutic possibilities of the applied technology. Dose distributions were obtained for anaplastic medulloblastoma, multifocal metastases to brain, vulva cancer, tongue cancer, metastases to bones, and advanced skin cancer. Tomotherapy treatment plans were compared with conventional linear accelerator plans. Following the comparative analysis of tomotherapy and conventional linear accelerator plans, in each case we obtained the increase in dose distribution conformity manifested in greater homogeneity of doses in the radiation target area for anaplastic medulloblastoma, multifocal metastases to brain, vulva cancer, metastases to bones, and advanced skin cancer, and the reduction of doses in organs at risk (OAR) for anaplastic medulloblastoma, vulva cancer, tongue cancer, and advanced skin cancer. The time of treatment delivery in the case of a tomotherapy machine is comparable to the implementation of the plan prepared in intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) technique for a conventional linear accelerator. In the case of tomotherapy the application of a fractional dose was carried out in each case during one working period of the machine. For a conventional linear accelerator the total value of the fractional dose in the case of anaplastic medulloblastoma and metastases to bones was delivered using several treatment plans, for which a change of set-up was necessary during a fraction. The obtained results confirm that tomotherapy offers the possibility to obtain precise treatment plans together with the simplification of the therapeutic system.",Tomasz T;Małgorzata M;Agata A;Adam A;Joanna J;Krystyna K;Aldona A;Małgorzata M;Hanna H
22206672,SPARC expression induces cell cycle arrest via STAT3 signaling pathway in medulloblastoma cells.,"Dynamic cell interaction with ECM components has profound influence in cancer progression. SPARC is a component of the ECM, impairs the proliferation of different cell types and modulates tumor cell aggressive features. We previously reported that SPARC expression significantly impairs medulloblastoma tumor growth in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of SPARC inhibits medulloblastoma cell proliferation. MTT assay indicated a dose-dependent reduction in tumor cell proliferation in adenoviral mediated expression of SPARC full length cDNA (Ad-DsRed-SP) in D425 and UW228 cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed that Ad-DsRed-SP-infected cells accumulate in the G2/M phase of cell cycle. Further, immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that SPARC induced G2/M cell cycle arrest was mediated through inhibition of the Cyclin-B-regulated signaling pathway involving p21 and Cdc2 expression. Additionally, expression of SPARC decreased STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr-705; constitutively active STAT3 expression reversed SPARC induced G2/M arrest. Ad-DsRed-SP significantly inhibited the pre-established orthotopic tumor growth and tumor volume in nude-mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections from mice treated with Ad-DsRed-SP showed decreased immunoreactivity for pSTAT3 and increased immunoreactivity for p21 compared to tumor section from mice treated with mock and Ad-DsRed. Taken together our studies further reveal that STAT3 plays a key role in SPARC induced G2/M arrest in medulloblastoma cells. These new findings provide a molecular basis for the mechanistic understanding of the effects of SPARC on medulloblastoma tumor cell proliferation.",Chandramu C;Ranadheer R;Purnachandra Nagaraju PN;Meena M;Sajani S SS
22201732,Musashi1: an RBP with versatile functions in normal and cancer stem cells.,"Musashi1 (Msi1) is a highly conserved RNA binding protein that was initially identified in Drosophila by its ability to regulate sensory organ development and asymmetric cell division. Studies in mammalian cells reveal multiple functions for Musashi1 in normal and abnormal processes by mediating different post-transcriptional processes. According to our recent studies, Musashi1 very likely controls hundreds of targets, forming networks that regulate apoptosis, differentiation, proliferation and cell cycle. Musashi1 is a characteristic stem cell marker that regulates the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Over-expression of Musashi1 has been associated with numerous tumor types and its function is required for tumor growth in breast, colon, medulloblastoma and glioblastoma. Musashi1 has also been implicated in neurogenesis and neurodegenerative diseases, and is emerging as a potential therapeutic target in both regenerative medicine and cancer.",Robert I RI;Dat T DT;Luiz O F LO
22200660,Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor with primitive neuroepithelial differentiation in an adult: a case report.,"Primitive neuroepithelial differentiation in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) has been reported in children but is extremely rare in adults. The authors report the case of a 70-year-old woman who presented with swelling of the right leg of 1-month duration. Fine-needle aspiration cytology was suggestive of a benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor. Histopathological examination of the excised mass revealed a MPNST with spindle-cell areas and a few round-cell areas with rosettes. The spindle cells showed positive immunoreactivity for S-100 protein and vimentin and negativity for desmin, confirming their nerve sheath origin. The round cells were immunoreactive for synaptophysin and chromogranin, indicating primitive neuroepithelial differentiation. These cells did not stain for CD99, which is consistently expressed by the cells of primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) of bone and soft tissue but not by central nervous system (CNS) PNETs or medulloblastomas. In this case, the PNET-like focus resembled a CNS-PNET.",Arti Rameshrao AR;Medha Pradeep MP;Nayan Anant NA;Alka Vikas AV;Kalpana Ranjitsingh KR
22189395,The molecular classification of medulloblastoma: driving the next generation clinical trials.,"Most children diagnosed with cancer today are expected to be cured. Medulloblastoma, the most common pediatric malignant brain tumor, is an example of a disease that has benefitted from advances in diagnostic imaging, surgical techniques, radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy over the past decades. It was an incurable disease 50 years ago, but approximately 70% of children with medulloblastoma are now cured of their disease. However, the pace of increasing the cure rate has slowed over the past 2 decades, and we have likely reached the maximal benefit that can be achieved with cytotoxic therapy and clinical risk stratification. Long-term toxicity of therapy also remains significant. To increase cure rates and decrease long-term toxicity, there is great interest in incorporating biologic 'targeted' therapy into treatment of medulloblastoma, but this will require a paradigm shift in how we classify and study disease. Using genome-based high-throughput analytic techniques, several groups have independently reported methods of molecular classification of medulloblastoma within the past year. This has resulted in a working consensus to view medulloblastoma as four molecular subtypes, including wingless-type murine mammary tumor virus integration site (WNT) pathway subtype, Sonic Hedgehog pathway subtype and two less well defined subtypes (groups C and D). Novel classification and risk stratification based on biologic subtypes of disease will form the basis of further study in medulloblastoma and identify specific subtypes that warrant greater research focus.",Sarah E S SE;James M JM
22188814,Cooperation between c-Met and focal adhesion kinase family members in medulloblastoma and implications for therapy.,"We previously showed the involvement of the tyrosine kinase receptor c-Met in medulloblastoma malignancy. The nonreceptor tyrosine kinases focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Pyk2 are key players in the progression of different cancers. However, their role in medulloblastoma malignancy is not well understood. In this study, using a protein array approach, we found that c-Met induces FAK and Pyk2 phosphorylation in medulloblastoma cells. We therefore studied the interactions between c-Met and FAK/Pyk2 and their implications for medulloblastoma therapy. We found that c-Met activates FAK and Pyk2 in several medulloblastoma cell lines. We also found that FAK and Pyk2 mediate the malignant effects of c-Met on medulloblastoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that combined c-Met and FAK inhibitions would have additive effects on the inhibition of medulloblastoma malignancy. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effects on medulloblastoma malignancy parameters of single or combined treatments of medulloblastoma cells with c-Met and FAK small-molecule kinase inhibitors. We found a significant increase in the inhibitory effect of both inhibitors on medulloblastoma cell migration and cell invasion as compared with single inhibitions (P < 0.05). In addition, oral gavage treatment with c-Met inhibitor of mice bearing medulloblastoma xenografts significantly reduced in vivo tumor growth. Therefore, combining c-Met inhibitors with FAK inhibitors constitutes a new potential strategy for medulloblastoma therapy. Altogether, our study describes a role for FAK and Pyk2 in medulloblastoma malignancy, uncovers new interactions between c-Met and FAK/Pyk2, and proposes for the first time combining anti-c-Met and anti-FAK inhibitors as a new strategy for medulloblastoma therapy.",Fadila F;Yanzhi Y;Elizabeth E;Lukasz L;Matthew M;Ying Y;Alexander A;David D;James J;Roger R

22173741,Medulloblasoma: challenges for effective immunotherapy.,"For medulloblastoma patients, the current therapeutic paradigm of surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy can lead to long-term remission. However, the sequelae of treatment can be very debilitating, particularly in young children. Immunotherapy is an attractive treatment approach to optimize the targeting of tumor cells while sparing the vulnerable surrounding brain that is still developing in children. Understanding the relationship between medulloblastoma and the immune system is critical to develop effective immunologic-based treatment strategies for these patients. This review focuses on current knowledge of tumor immunology and the factors that contribute to the lack of immune system recognition of these tumors. The specificity of tumor antigens present in medulloblastoma is also discussed along with a summary of early clinical immunotherapy results.",Adam M AM;Alfred T AT;Lisa M LM;David E DE;Peter P;Jeffrey N JN;Richard C E RC

22162424,Preliminary experience with personalized and targeted therapy for pediatric brain tumors.,"A new generation of anticancer drugs has reached clinical care in common diseases, but their use in rare diseases such as pediatric brain tumors lags behind since conventional clinical trial design requires larger patient numbers. We designed individualized treatment protocols for pediatric patients with relapsed brain tumors, based upon the patient's treatment history. In addition, each tumor was analyzed with morphoproteomics using a panel of markers to show treatment targets, resulting in a list of potential novel drugs to be added to chemotherapy. Here, we present the concept and report the experiences of the first patients enrolled in the program. Eleven treatment protocols were designed using morphoproteomic information and given to eight patients. The histological diagnoses included: medulloblastoma (n = 3), glioblastoma multiforme (n = 2), atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (n = 1), choroid plexus carcinoma (n = 1), and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (n = 1). Tumor markers included p-ERK, Topoisomerase IIa, Bcl-2, VEGF-A, p-STAT3, ER-beta, p-mTOR, and p-NF-kappaBp65. The novel agents included sorafenib, bevacizumab, fulvestrant, rapamycin, bortezomib, and curcumin. The response to the first protocol was complete response: 1, partial response: 1, stable disease: 0, progressive disease: 4, and continuous complete remission: 2. The median Event-Free Survival was 0.32 year ± 0.4. For the comparison with the institutional control group, the individual response probability was calculated. The observed response was superior to the historical controls (P = 0.006 Whitman U-test). This approach warrants further, systematic evaluation as proof of concept and then expansion to drug-specific hypotheses.",Johannes E JE;Robert E RE;Jamie J;Stefan S;Tribhawan S TS;Michael E ME
22160402,Biological and clinical heterogeneity of MYCN-amplified medulloblastoma.,"Focal high-level amplifications of MYC (or MYCC) define a subset of high-risk medulloblastoma patients. However, the prognostic role of MYCN oncogene amplification remains unresolved. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of this alteration alone and in combination with biological modifiers in 67 pediatric medulloblastomas with MYCN amplification (MYCN-MB). Twenty-one MYCN-MB were examined using gene expression profiling and array-CGH, whereas for 46 tumors immunohistochemical analysis and FISH were performed. All 67 tumors were further subjected to mutational analyses. We compared molecular, clinical, and prognostic characteristics both within biological MYCN-MB groups and with non-amplified tumors. Transcriptomic analysis revealed SHH-driven tumorigenesis in a subset of MYCN-MBs indicating a biological dichotomy of MYCN-MB. Activation of SHH was accompanied by variant-specific cytogenetic aberrations including deletion of 9q in SHH tumors. Non-SHH MB were associated with gain of 7q and isochromosome 17q/17q gain. Among clinically relevant variables, SHH subtype and 10q loss for non-SHH tumors comprised the most powerful markers of favorable prognosis in MYCN-MB. In conclusion, we demonstrate considerable heterogeneity within MYCN-MB in terms of genetics, tumor biology, and clinical outcome. Thus, assessment of disease group and 10q copy-number status may improve risk stratification of this group and may delineate MYCN-MB with the same dismal prognosis as MYC amplified tumors. Furthermore, based on the enrichment of MYCN and GLI2 amplifications in SHH-driven medulloblastoma, amplification of these downstream signaling intermediates should be taken into account before a patient is enrolled into a clinical trial using a smoothened inhibitor.",Andrey A;Marc M;Marcel M;Thomas T;Paul A PA;Dan D;Elke E;Hendrik H;David T W DT;Marina M;Yoon-Jae YJ;Andrea A;Axel A;William A WA;Andreas A;Wolfram W;Andreas E AE;Steven C SC;V V;Frank F;Michael D MD;Peter P;Stefan M SM
22156796,Treatment for recurrent medulloblastoma with intrathecal liposomal cytarabine and systemic metronomic combination therapy.,"The prognosis of recurrent medulloblastoma is dismal, with a median survival of less than 1 year. Our patient was initially diagnosed with high-risk medulloblastoma when he was 14 years old. He had a recurrence 18 months after the end of therapy. Recurrence treatment consisted of 13 intrathecal applications of liposomal cytarabine over an 18-month period, and oral metronomic antiangiogenic therapy with thalidomide, celecoxib, and etoposide. Side effects from the intrathecal treatment were most likely related to arachnoiditis despite prolonged prophylaxis with steroids. He also developed partial hearing loss. Neutropenia was the main side effect of the metronomic therapy. He remains alive, with a good quality of life and without evidence of disease 34 months from the start of recurrence therapy. This combination of local antineoplastic and systemic antiangiogenic therapy seems to be promising for recurrent medulloblastoma. However, more patients and standardized protocols are needed to verify the benefit of this combination therapy and to define the correct duration of treatment.",Randi R;Sanna-Maria SM
22153617,CRABP-II methylation: a critical determinant of retinoic acid resistance of medulloblastoma cells.,"Medulloblastoma cells exhibit varied responses to therapy by all-trans retinoic acid (RA). The underlying mechanism for such diverse effects however remains largely unclear. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the molecular basis of RA resistance through the study of RA signaling components in both RA-sensitive (Med-3) and RA-resistant (UW228-2 and UW228-3) medulloblastoma cells. The results revealed that RARα/β/γ and RXRα/β/γ were found in the three cell lines. Expression of CRABP-I and CRABP-II was seen in Med-3 cells, up-regulated when treated with RA, but was absent in UW228-2 and UW228-3 cells regardless of RA treatment. Bisulfite sequencing revealed 8 methylated CG sites at the promoter region of CRABP-II in UW228-2 and UW228-3 but not in Med-3 cells. Demethylation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine recovered CRABP-II expression. Upon restoration of CRABP-II expression, both UW228-2 and UW228-3 cells responded to RA treatment by forming neuronal-like differentiation, synaptophysin expression, β-III tubulin upregulation, and apoptosis. Furthermore, CRABP-II specific siRNA reduced RA sensitivity in Med-3 cells. Tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical staining showed variable CRABP-II expression patterns among 104 medulloblastoma cases, ranging from negative (42.3%), partly positive (14.4%) to positive (43.3%). CRABP-II expression was positively correlated with synaptophysin (rs = 0.317; p = 0.001) but not with CRABP-I expression (p > 0.05). In conclusion, aberrant methylation in CRABP-II reduces the expression of CRABP-II that in turn confers RA resistance in medulloblastoma cells. Determination of CRABP-II expression or methylation status may enable a personalized RA therapy in patients with medulloblastomas and other types of cancers.",Yuan-Shan YS;Qian Q;Jing-Xin JX;Xiang-Hong XH;Mo-Li ML;Kai-Li KL;Qing-You QY;Xiao-Yan XY;Yuan Y;Nan-Nan NN;Xiao-Hong XH;Hong H;Jia J
22153558,A long duration of the prediagnostic symptomatic interval is not associated with an unfavourable prognosis in childhood medulloblastoma.,"Due to the lacking specificity of symptoms making a correct diagnosis can be a challenge in children with medulloblastoma. This can lead to prediagnostic symptomatic intervals (PSIs) of several weeks to months. It is unknown whether the length of the PSI is associated with an inferior survival outcome in this population. To study the association of PSI with disease stage at diagnosis, tumour control and survival in children with medulloblastoma, prospectively collected data on PSI, clinical, and biological features were analysed in 224 patients diagnosed at the age of 3-18 years and treated within the prospective randomised multicentre trial HIT'91. Patients with lower-stage disease tended towards a longer median PSI than those with higher-stage disease (M0 stage, 2.0 months; M1 stage, 2.0 months; M2/M3 stage, 1 month; p = 0.094. M0/1 stage versus M2/3 stage; p = 0.025). The patient group with the longest PSI had the best survival outcome (PSI ≥ 4.0 months: 10-year overall survival rate (OS), 71%; PSI < 4.0 months, 10-year OS, 61%; p = 0.056). Age at diagnosis was positively correlated with PSI (p = 0.027). No associations were found between PSI and sex histological subtype, presence of postoperative residual tumour, or c-myc and TrkC mRNA expression. Contrary to a common belief that a longer PSI may adversely affect prognosis, a longer PSI was associated with a trend towards lower metastatic stage and better survival probabilities. Nevertheless these findings do not obviate the importance of a timely diagnosis in paediatric patients with medulloblastoma.",Nicolas U NU;Katja K;André O AO;Wiebke W;Frank F;Martin M;Isabella I;Niels N;Monika M;Torsten T;Uwe U;Joachim J;Rolf-Dieter RD;Michael A MA;Stefan S
22151431,Glioblastoma occurring at the site of a previous medulloblastoma following a 5-year remission period.,"We describe a case of a 14-year-old boy who developed a cerebellar and brainstem glioblastoma 5 years after treatment for a medulloblastoma. The patient first presented in 2003 with 9 months of vomiting and a 9-kg weight loss. A head MRI showed a heterogeneously enhancing posterior fossa mass with hydrocephalus. Gross total resection was performed and the tumor was consistent with a classic medulloblastoma. Postoperative chemotherapy and craniospinal radiation was administered. The patient remained tumor-free until 2008, at which time he presented with right-sided weakness and numbness, left eye pain, vomiting and weight loss. Imaging showed abnormalities within the posterior pons, medulla, inferior cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar hemispheres and cervicomedullary junction with expansion of the medulla and cervical spinal cord. Due to the location of the lesion, biopsy was felt to be too risky and was avoided. Despite receiving chemotherapy, his symptoms continued to worsen and he died 4 months later. Post mortem examination limited to the brain and spinal cord confirmed the radiographic extent of the tumor. Microscopic examination showed a highly cellular infiltrative glial neoplasm with extensive palisading necrosis. A diagnosis of glioblastoma was rendered. The question of whether the first and second tumors were related is of potential clinical and academic interest. The first tumor was synaptophysin-positive and GFAP-negative, consistent with medulloblastoma. The second tumor was synaptophysin-negative and focally GFAP-positive, consistent with glioblastoma. The glioblastoma displayed EGF receptor amplification, and interestingly, it also displayed MYCN amplification; both tumors showed low level PTEN deletion. The medulloblastoma displayed a signal pattern consistent with an isochromosome 17q, while the glioblastoma showed some cells with an isochromosome 17q signal pattern amid a background of cells with abundant chromosomal instability. The relationship between these two tumors, particularly with regard to various molecular events, is discussed.",Sarah E SE;Daniel J DJ;Gail H GH;Ryan R;Haki H;Annette C AC;Eyas M EM
22147459,Antiangiogenic metronomic therapy for children with recurrent embryonal brain tumors.,"Median survival time of recurrent embryonal brain tumors is short regardless of salvage chemotherapy used. An evolving alternative approach to conventional chemotherapy is to target neovascularization by interfering with tumor angiogenesis at various levels. From November 2006 to December 2010, 16 patients (median age: 9 years) with recurrent (9 first, 7 multiple) embryonal brain tumors were treated with an antiangiogenic multidrug combination regimen (bevacizumab, thalidomide, celecoxib, fenofibrate, etoposide, and cyclophophamide) and additional intraventricular therapy (etoposide and liposomal cytarabine). At a median of 33 months, 10/16 patients are alive. 4/4 patients with CNS primitive neuroectodermal tumors (CNS PNET) and 1/7 patients with medulloblastoma (MB) died of tumor progression during the first year. Another patient with MB died of an accident after 23 months, the remaining five patients with MB are alive for 12, 33, 33, 37, and 58 months. For the seven patients with MB, both overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) after 6 months was 100%, after 12 months 85.7 ± 13%, and after 24 months 68.6 ± 19%. In contrast, for patients with CNS PNET, both OS and EFS after 6 months was 75.0 ± 22% and 0.0% and all patients had died by 12 months. Low-dose oral etoposide and cyclophosphamide was reduced after a median of 2 months and discontinued after a median of 11 months. Toxicities were manageable and therapy was generally well tolerated. Our results suggest that the chosen antiangiogenic drug combination is particularly beneficial for patients with MB and warrants further investigation.",Andreas A;Monika M;Mark W MW;Amedeo A AA;Christina C;Thomas T;Karin K;Maria-Theresa MT;Christine C;Ulrike U;Irene I

22146535,Preclinical testing of tandutinib in a transgenic medulloblastoma mouse model.,"Overexpression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-A) has been documented in association with primary tumors and metastasis in medulloblastoma. Tumors from our genetically engineered sonic hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma mouse model overexpress PDGFR-A in primary tumors and thus this mouse model is a good platform with which to study the role of PDGFR-A in this central nervous system malignancy. We hypothesized that inhibition of PDGFR-A in medulloblastoma can slow or inhibit tumor progression in living individuals. To test our hypothesis, we targeted PDGFR-A mediated tumor growth in vitro and in vivo using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tandutinib (MLN-518), which strongly inhibits PDGFR-A. Although PDGFR-A inhibition by this agent resulted in reduced mouse tumor cell growth and increased apoptosis in vitro, and reduced tumor cell proliferation in vivo, tandutinib did reduce tumor volume at the doses tested (360 mg/kg) in vivo. Thus, tandutinib may be an agent of interest for sonic hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma if a synergistic drug combination can be identified.",Sachiko S;Monika A MA;Suresh I SI;Jinu J;Sangeet S;Laura D LD;Aoife A;Francis J FJ;Martha A MA;Brian P BP;Charles C
22139329,MYC family amplification and clinical risk-factors interact to predict an extremely poor prognosis in childhood medulloblastoma.,"The MYC oncogenes are the most commonly amplified loci in medulloblastoma, and have previously been proposed as biomarkers of adverse disease prognosis by us and others. Here, we report focussed and comprehensive investigations of MYCC, MYCN and MYCL in an extensive medulloblastoma cohort (n = 292), aimed to define more precisely their biological significance and optimal clinical application to direct improved disease risk-stratification and individualisation of therapy. MYCC and MYCN expression elevations were multifactorial, associated with high-risk (gene amplification, large-cell/anaplastic pathology (LCA)) and favourable-risk (WNT/SHH molecular subgroups) disease features. Highly variable cellular gene amplification patterns underlay overall MYC copy number elevations observed in tumour biopsies; we used these alternative measures together to define quantitative methodologies and thresholds for amplification detection in routinely collected tumour material. MYCC and MYCN amplification, but not gain, each had independent prognostic significance in non-infants (≥3.0-16.0 years), but MYCC conferred a greater hazard to survival than MYCN when considered across this treatment group. MYCN's weaker group-wide survival relationship may be explained by its pleiotropic behaviour between clinical disease-risk groups; MYCN predicted poor prognosis in clinical high-risk (metastatic (M+) or LCA), but not standard-risk, patients. Extending these findings, survival decreased in proportion to the total number of independently significant high-risk features present (LCA, M+ or MYCC/MYCN amplification). This cumulative-risk model defines a patient group characterised by ≥2 independent risk-factors and an extremely poor prognosis (<15% survival), which can be identified straightforwardly using the reported MYC amplification detection methodologies alongside clinical assessments, enabling targeting for novel/intensified therapies in future clinical studies.",Sarra L SL;Ed C EC;Michael M;Yuan Y;Meryl E ME;Hisham H;Kieran K;Sarah Leigh SL;Laszlo L;Miklos M;Peter P;Andrey A;Stefan M SM;Daniel D;Roger E RE;David W DW;Simon S;Steven C SC
22134538,MicroRNA-182 promotes leptomeningeal spread of non-sonic hedgehog-medulloblastoma.,"The contribution of microRNAs to the initiation, progression, and metastasis of medulloblastoma (MB) remains poorly understood. Metastatic dissemination at diagnosis is present in about 30% of MB patients, and is associated with a dismal prognosis. Using microRNA expression profiling, we demonstrate that the retinal miR-183-96-182 cluster on chromosome 7q32 is highly overexpressed in non-sonic hedgehog MBs (non-SHH-MBs). Expression of miR-182 and miR-183 is associated with cerebellar midline localization, and miR-182 is significantly overexpressed in metastatic MB as compared to non-metastatic tumors. Overexpression of miR-182 in non-SHH-MB increases and knockdown of miR-182 decreases cell migration in vitro. Xenografts overexpressing miR-182 invaded adjacent normal tissue and spread to the leptomeninges, phenotypically reminiscent of clinically highly aggressive large cell anaplastic MB. Hence, our study provides strong in vitro and in vivo evidence that miR-182 contributes to leptomeningeal metastatic dissemination in non-SHH-MB. We therefore reason that targeted inhibition of miR-182 may prevent leptomeningeal spread in patients with non-SHH-MB.",Alfa H C AH;Till T;Marc M;Claudio G CG;Thomas T;Yoon-Jae YJ;Marcel M;Paul A PA;Manfred M;Alexandr V AV;Stefan B SB;Andreas E AE;Armin A;Axel A;Michael D MD;Scott L SL;Ralf R;Olaf O;Andrey A;Peter P;Stefan M SM
22134537,Molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma: the current consensus.,"Medulloblastoma, a small blue cell malignancy of the cerebellum, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric oncology. Current mechanisms for clinical prognostication and stratification include clinical factors (age, presence of metastases, and extent of resection) as well as histological subgrouping (classic, desmoplastic, and large cell/anaplastic histology). Transcriptional profiling studies of medulloblastoma cohorts from several research groups around the globe have suggested the existence of multiple distinct molecular subgroups that differ in their demographics, transcriptomes, somatic genetic events, and clinical outcomes. Variations in the number, composition, and nature of the subgroups between studies brought about a consensus conference in Boston in the fall of 2010. Discussants at the conference came to a consensus that the evidence supported the existence of four main subgroups of medulloblastoma (Wnt, Shh, Group 3, and Group 4). Participants outlined the demographic, transcriptional, genetic, and clinical differences between the four subgroups. While it is anticipated that the molecular classification of medulloblastoma will continue to evolve and diversify in the future as larger cohorts are studied at greater depth, herein we outline the current consensus nomenclature, and the differences between the medulloblastoma subgroups.",Michael D MD;Paul A PA;Andrey A;Marc M;Yoon-Jae YJ;Steven C SC;Charles G CG;D Williams DW;Stefan S;Amar A;David W DW;Peter P;Richard J RJ;Scott L SL;Marcel M;Stefan M SM

22120608,Novel cell lines established from pediatric brain tumors.,"The paucity of cell culture models for childhood brain tumors prompted us to establish pediatric cell lines for use in biological experiments and preclinical developmental therapeutic studies. Three cell lines were established, CHLA-200 (GBM), CHLA-259 (anaplastic medulloblastoma) and CHLA-266 (atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor, AT/RT). Consistent with an AT/RT origin, CHLA-266 lacked INI1 expression and had monosomy 22. All lines had unique DNA short tandem repeat ""fingerprints"" matching that of the patient's tumor tissue and were adherent on tissue culture plastic, but differed in morphology and doubling times. CHLA-200 had a silent mutation in TP53. CHLA-259 and CHLA-266 had wild-type TP53. All three lines were relatively resistant to multiple drugs when compared to the DAOY medulloblastoma cell line, using the DIMSCAN fluorescence digital image microscopy cytotoxicity assay. RNA expression of MYC and MYCN were quantified using RT-PCR (Taqman). CHLA-200 expressed MYC, DAOY and CHLA-259 expressed MYCN, and CHLA-266 expressed both MYCN and MYC. CHLA-200 was only tumorigenic subcutaneously, but CHLA-259 and CHLA-266 were tumorigenic both subcutaneously and in brains of NOD/SCID mice. Immunohistochemistry of the xenografts revealed GFAP staining in CHLA-200 and PGP 9.5 staining in CHLA-259 and CHLA-266 tumors. As expected, INI1 expression was lacking in CHLA-266 (AT/RT).

22120270,Surgical treatment of brain tumors in infants younger than six months of age and review of the literature.,"Brain tumors are rare in infants who are younger than six months of age. These tumors can be challenging to treat surgically. We analyzed a modern series of patients treated by a multidisciplinary team at a tertiary care center and performed a literature review of this unique population. Retrospective clinical data were collected for patients surgically treated for intracranial mass lesions at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from 1998 to 2007. Dermoid cysts and other skull-based lesions were excluded from the analysis. Sixteen patients younger than six months of age underwent surgery for primary intracranial mass lesions. The median age of the patients at surgery was 5.2 months (range, 1.4-6 months of age). Children most often presented with a bulging fontanelle, hydrocephalus, or macrocephaly (seven patients). Vomiting was seen in five patients, cranial nerve palsies in one patient, and seizures in three patients. All patients had tumor resections and postoperatively were monitored in the intensive care unit. The final pathology consisted of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (three patients), primitive neuroectodermal tumor/medulloblastoma (three patients), choroid plexus papilloma (two patients), astrocytoma (two patients), ganglioglioma (two patients), desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma (two patients), glioblastoma multiforme (one patient), and choroid plexus carcinoma (one patient). Two intraoperative deaths occurred. Of the surviving 14, a gross total resection was achieved in four. Adjuvant therapy was determined by a multidisciplinary team composed of neuro-oncology, neurosurgery, and radiation oncology. Seven patients were treated with chemotherapy, and one patient had proton beam therapy. Five-year overall survival was 45%. The eight surviving patients had neurological sequelae, and developmental outcome was variable. Brain tumors are uncommon in children younger than six months of age. Patients present with a variety of tumor pathologies. Children who survive have neurological sequelae.

22119199,A phase I and pharmacokinetic study of plitidepsin in children with advanced solid tumours: an Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer (ITCC) study.,"To determine the maximum tolerated dose, the recommended dose (RD) for phase II studies, dose-limiting toxicities and pharmacokinetics (PK) for plitidepsin administered as a 3-h intravenous infusion every 2weeks (one cycle) to children with refractory or relapsed solid tumours. Consecutive cohorts of patients were treated according to a standard '3+3' design with escalating doses of plitidepsin at 4, 5 and 6mg/m(2). Additional 15 patients were recruited at the RD to further evaluate safety and pharmacokinetic associations with respect to age, dose level and toxicity. Thirty-eight of 41 patients registered received plitidepsin. Dose-limiting toxicities during the first three treatment cycles related to myalgia, elevated creatine phosphokinase, transaminase increase and nausea/vomiting. The RD for plitidepsin is 5mg/m(2). PK analyses revealed high inter-patient variability in plasma, but a similar clearance of plitidepsin in children and adolescents. One partial response confirmed at 4weeks in a patient with neuroblastoma and one unconfirmed partial response in a pancreatoblastoma were observed; four other patients with neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, glioblastoma and rhabdoid tumour had disease stabilisations lasting ⩾3months. Plitidepsin administered to children as a 3-h infusion every 2weeks is received with manageable toxicity for children with cancer, and the RD is 5mg/m(2).

22113362,Analysis of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation in 97 patients with glioma.,"The objective of this study is to investigate the expression and significance of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation in different subtypes of human gliomas. Direct DNA sequencing, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect IDH1 mutation and IDH1 gene expression levels in 97 cases of glioma and 9 cases of other CNS tumors. IDH1 mutation was heterozygous, with wild-type arginine 132 replaced by histidine (R132H). Expression in different glioma subtypes was (1) 0 out if 5 in pilocytic astrocytoma; (2) 15 out of 22 in diffuse astrocytoma, 6 out of 9 in oligodendroglioma, 4 out of 6 in oligoastrocytoma, and 0 out of 4 in ependymoma; (3) 11 out of 19 in anaplastic astrocytoma, 4 out of 7 in anaplastic oligodendroglioma, 3 out of 4 in anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, and 0 out of 3 in anaplastic ependymoma; and (4) 1 out of 6 in primary glioblastoma, 8 out of 10 in secondary glioblastoma, and 0 out of 2 in medulloblastoma. IDH1 mutation is a somatic mutation that is found only in some glioma subtypes. It can be used as a molecular marker for glioma subtypes. For example, it can be used to distinguish primary glioblastoma from secondary glioblastoma, combining TP53 mutation and loss of heterozygosity involving 1p/19q. It can also be used as a marker for some gliomas. For example, it can be used to distinguish pilocytic astrocytoma from diffuse astrocytoma, combining detected BRAF proto-oncogene mutations.",You-Xin YX;Jun-Xiang JX;Ming M;Chun-Ming CM;Ting T;Gui-Lin GL;Zi-Wei ZW
22109636,Central nervous system (CNS) tumor trends in children in a western Canadian province: a population-based 22-year retrospective study.,"In Canada, CNS tumors accounted for nearly 22% of the new childhood cancer diagnoses during 1995-2000 in the ≤ 15 year age group. The study's objective was to describe children and youth (age <20 years) diagnosed with CNS tumors in Alberta, Canada during a 22-year period using population-based data. The Alberta Cancer registry was used to extract information, including sex, age and geography, on all CNS (ICCC-3 III) tumor diagnoses during April 1, 1982, and March 31, 2004. Analyses included population summaries and rates. During 22 fiscal years, 568 Alberta children were diagnosed with CNS tumors and nearly 82% of the cases were malignant (461). The majority of cases were male (322, 57%) and the median age at diagnosis was 8 years. The crude rate per 100,000 children increased over the study period from 2.1 in 1983/1984 to 4.2 in 2003/2004. Astrocytoma was the most common diagnosis (257, 45%), followed by medulloblastoma (12%), mixed and unspecified glioma (9%) and ependymoma (9%). There were 86 diagnoses of juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (55% male) and the crude rates per 100,000 increased during the study (<0.5 in the early years to 1.15 in 2003/2004). Our data suggests an emerging trend with the latter few years having a seemingly higher standardized incidence rate than earlier years. Further study is required to determine if the trend persists.",Rhonda J RJ;Adrienne A;Bev B;Kent K
22105614,Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cancer stem cells: do they exist?,"Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) comprise a broad range of neoplasms that share biological and embryological origin. A deeper knowledge in the underlying molecular biology that results in the development and spread of NETs has allowed the use of novel-targeted therapies against angiogenesis and intracellular pathways, key checkpoints that govern growth, and proliferation of these tumors. Unfortunately, the possibility of cure is still far for patients with advanced stages. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are present in most solid tumors. Nevertheless, there is limited evidence for the presence of CSCs in NETs. In this review, we will discuss the embryonic origin and possible existence of a gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine cancer stem cell. Here, we summarize the body of evidence supporting the presence of active embryological pathways like Notch, Wnt-β-catenin, Hedgehog, or transforming growth factor-β in NETs. New therapeutic approaches in the field of CSCs seem to have a clear role in the treatment of medulloblastomas and basal cell carcinomas, but their future value in other solid tumor types including NETs remains unclear.",Enrique E;Jaume J;Jorge J;Luis L;Daniel D
22090452,"Prognostic classification of pediatric medulloblastoma based on chromosome 17p loss, expression of MYCC and MYCN, and Wnt pathway activation.","Pediatric medulloblastoma is considered a highly heterogeneous disease and a new strategy of risk stratification to optimize therapeutic outcomes is required. We aimed to investigate a new risk-stratification approach based on expression profiles of medulloblastoma cohorts. We analyzed gene expression profiles of 30 primary medulloblastomas and detected strong evidence that poor survival outcome was significantly associated with mRNA expression profiles of 17p loss. However, it was not supported in independent cohorts from previously published data (n = 100). We speculated that this discrepancy might come from complex conditions of two important prognostic determinants: loss of tumor suppressors (chromosome 17p) and high expression of oncogenes c-myc (MYCC) or N-myc (MYCN). When patients were stratified into 5 or 7 subgroups based on simultaneous consideration of these 2 factors while defining the Wnt group as independent, obviously different survival expectancies were detected between the subgroups. For instance, predicted 5-year survival probabilities ranged from 19% to 81% in the 5 subgroups. We also found that age became a significant prognostic marker after adjusting for 17p, MYCC, and MYCN status. Diminished survival in age <3 years was more substantial in subgroups with high expression of MYCC, MYCN, or 17p loss but not in other subgroups, indicating that poor survival outcome might be synergistically affected by these 3 factors. Here we suggest a more tailored subgrouping system based on expression profiles of chromosome 17p, MYCC, and MYCN, which could provide the basis for a novel risk-stratification strategy in pediatric medulloblastoma.",Ae Kyung AK;Seung-Jun SJ;Ji Hoon JH;Kyu-Chang KC;Dong Gyu DG;Byung-Kyu BK;Christine C;Sarah S;Christelle C;Stéphanie S;Christian C;Franck F;Jacques J;Olivier O;Seung-Ki SK;Woong-Yang WY
22084163,"Effective targeting of Hedgehog signaling in a medulloblastoma model with PF-5274857, a potent and selective Smoothened antagonist that penetrates the blood-brain barrier.","Inhibition of the Smoothened (Smo) represents a promising therapeutic strategy for treating malignant tumors that are dependent on the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. PF-5274857 is a novel Smo antagonist that specifically binds to Smo with a K(i) of 4.6 ± 1.1 nmol/L and completely blocks the transcriptional activity of the downstream gene Gli1 with an IC(50) of 2.7 ± 1.4 nmol/L in cells. This Smo antagonist showed robust antitumor activity in a mouse model of medulloblastoma with an in vivo IC(50) of 8.9 ± 2.6 nmol/L. The downregulation of Gli1 is closely linked to the tumor growth inhibition in patched(+/-) medulloblastoma mice. Mathematical analysis of the relationship between the drug's pharmacokinetics and Gli1 pharmacodynamics in patched(+/-) medulloblastoma tumor models yielded similar tumor and skin Gli1 IC(50) values, suggesting that skin can be used as a surrogate tissue for the measurement of tumor Gli1 levels. In addition, PF-5274857 was found to effectively penetrate the blood-brain barrier and inhibit Smo activity in the brain of primary medulloblastoma mice, resulting in improved animal survival rates. The brain permeability of PF-5274857 was also confirmed and quantified in nontumor-bearing preclinical species with an intact blood-brain barrier. PF-5274857 was orally available and metabolically stable in vivo. These findings suggest that PF-5274857 is a potentially attractive clinical candidate for the treatment of tumor types including brain tumors and brain metastasis driven by an activated Hh pathway.",Allison A;Mary E ME;Justine L JL;Bernadette B;Darian D;Qing John QJ;Amy H AH;Greg G;Meirong M;Peter A PA;Simon S;Sajiv S;Shaoxian S
22080382,The evaluation of function and the ultrasonographic picture of thyroid in children treated for medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is one of the most frequent and sensitive to radiation aggressive brain tumor in children. Abnormalities of the thyroid function are common complications of head and neck irradiation for childhood cancer. The aim of this study was to assess thyroid function in children treated for medulloblastoma according to the treatment protocol phase. Twenty-three children with MB were enrolled to this study. All patients underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy to the whole craniospinal axis and boost with the conformal therapy restricted to the tumor bed to a total dose of 54 Gy. Thyroid function was evaluated based on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4) levels controlled before MB treatment, directly after irradiation and at the end of the treatment protocol. Ultrasonography has been used to detect parenchymal abnormalities. All patients presented normal thyroid hormone range before chemotherapy. Hypothyroidism was found in 12 patients in the course of treatment, in 2 patients hormone deficits diagnosed directly after irradiation, in 10 patients such condition was observed at the end of the whole therapy. All of these patients needed thyroid hormone substitution. None of them presented clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism. Ultrasound-detected abnormalities have been found in 20 patients. It is crucial to monitor the functions of the thyroid gland in children treated for medulloblastoma because of the high risk of hypothyroidism resulting from the treatment. The change in the echogenicity of the thyroid gland may be an early marker for a dysfunction of this organ in children treated for medulloblastoma.",G G;K K;M M;B B;A A;K K;M M;H H;E E
22071791,Multifocal presentation of medulloblastoma in adulthood.,"Medulloblastoma in adulthood is uncommon but not rare; annual incidence is 2-20/1,000,000. Some peculiarities characterize medulloblastoma in adult patients compared with the child type: lateral cerebellar location, heterogeneous signal intensity on magnetic resonance imaging, desmoplastic histological variant, and more favourable prognosis. Preoperative diagnosis is crucial for correct management of these patients. However, because of the low incidence of medulloblastoma in the adult population, preoperative diagnosis remains challenging and prognostic factors and best treatment options are still controversial. In this setting, some unusual findings, for example multifocal presentation and extra-axial location, can confound diagnosis and make treatment difficult. We present a short case-illustrated review on these remarkable issues.",Pietro P;Antonino A;Marta M;Renzo R;Enrico E;Franco F;Giuseppe G;Domenico D;Renato R;Alessandro A
22070547,Review: personalized mice: modelling the molecular heterogeneity of medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour, is thought to arise from mutations in progenitors or stem cells in the cerebellum. Recent molecular analyses have highlighted the heterogeneity of these tumours, and demonstrated that they can be classified into at least four major subtypes that differ in terms of gene expression, genomic gains and losses, epidemiology and patient outcome. Along with analysis of human tumours, a variety of animal models of medulloblastoma have been developed using transgenic and knockout technology as well as somatic gene delivery. These models have provided valuable insight into the origins of the disease and the signalling pathways that control tumour growth. But the degree to which current models recapitulate the heterogeneity of the human disease remains unclear. Here we review the recent literature on the genomics of medulloblastoma and discuss the relationship of mouse models to the subtypes of the disease. Judicious use of existing models, and generation of additional models for poorly studied subtypes of medulloblastoma, will increase our understanding of tumour biology and allow evaluation of novel approaches to treatment of the disease.",S L SL;R J RJ
22057785,"Rapid, reliable, and reproducible molecular sub-grouping of clinical medulloblastoma samples.","The diagnosis of medulloblastoma likely encompasses several distinct entities, with recent evidence for the existence of at least four unique molecular subgroups that exhibit distinct genetic, transcriptional, demographic, and clinical features. Assignment of molecular subgroup through routine profiling of high-quality RNA on expression microarrays is likely impractical in the clinical setting. The planning and execution of medulloblastoma clinical trials that stratify by subgroup, or which are targeted to a specific subgroup requires technologies that can be economically, rapidly, reliably, and reproducibly applied to formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens. In the current study, we have developed an assay that accurately measures the expression level of 22 medulloblastoma subgroup-specific signature genes (CodeSet) using nanoString nCounter Technology. Comparison of the nanoString assay with Affymetrix expression array data on a training series of 101 medulloblastomas of known subgroup demonstrated a high concordance (Pearson correlation r = 0.86). The assay was validated on a second set of 130 non-overlapping medulloblastomas of known subgroup, correctly assigning 98% (127/130) of tumors to the appropriate subgroup. Reproducibility was demonstrated by repeating the assay in three independent laboratories in Canada, the United States, and Switzerland. Finally, the nanoString assay could confidently predict subgroup in 88% of recent FFPE cases, of which 100% had accurate subgroup assignment. We present an assay based on nanoString technology that is capable of rapidly, reliably, and reproducibly assigning clinical FFPE medulloblastoma samples to their molecular subgroup, and which is highly suited for future medulloblastoma clinical trials.",Paul A PA;David J H DJ;Marc M;Yoon-Jae YJ;Marcel M;Cynthia C;Charles G CG;Adrian A;Toumy T;Yoslayma Y;Eric E;Scott L SL;Marco M;David D;James T JT;Andrey A;Stefan S;Michael D MD
22054800,Low-grade bone lesions in survivors of childhood medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor.,"Medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (MB/PNET) is the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system (CNS) in children. MB/PNET survivors are at an increased risk for developing second malignancies. Little has been reported on development of low-grade lesions of the calvarium in the radiation field in MB/PNET survivors. The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency of the low-grade bone lesion development in the radiotherapy field in pediatric MB/PNET survivors and describe the imaging characteristics of these lesions. Institutional review board approval was obtained for this retrospective review which was compliant with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Forty-one MB/PNET patients (29 male) who survived for at least 2 years after initiation of radiation therapy were included. The medical records were reviewed. The most recent available brain magnetic resonance imaging studies were evaluated. Three patients (7.3%) developed low-grade calvarial lesions and underwent resection and/or biopsy of the lesions. There were one Langerhans cell histiocytosis, one benign spindle cell lesion with myxoid change, and one fibrous dysplasia. Development of low-grade bone lesions of calvarium is not very rare in pediatric PNET/MB survivors. Bones in the radiation therapy field need to be carefully examined for assessment of secondary lesions.",Korgun K;Dave D;Charles F CF;Lynn L;Daniel C DC
22052462,CXCR4 activation defines a new subgroup of Sonic hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma prognosis tends to be poor, despite aggressive therapy, but defining molecular subgroups may identify patients who could benefit from targeted therapies. This study used human gene array and associated clinical data to identify a new molecular subgroup of medulloblastoma characterized by coactivation of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and CXCR4 pathways. SHH-CXCR4 tumors were more common in the youngest patients where they were associated with desmoplastic histology. In contrast to tumors activating SHH but not CXCR4, coactivated tumors exhibited greater expression of Math1 and cyclin D1. Treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 inhibited cyclin D1 expression and maximal tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic investigations revealed that SHH activation stimulated CXCR4 cell surface localization and effector signaling activity, whereas SHH absence caused CXCR4 to assume an intracellular localization. Taken together, our findings define a new medulloblastoma subgroup characterized by a functional interaction between the SHH and CXCR4 pathways, and they provide a rationale to clinically evaluate combined inhibition of SHH and CXCR4 for medulloblastoma treatment.",Rajarshi R;Adrian A;Stacey S;Lihua L;Paul P;B Mark BM;Kirsten K;Jingqin J;Michael D MD;Robert J RJ;Joshua B JB
22037313,WIP1 enhances tumor formation in a sonic hedgehog-dependent model of medulloblastoma.,"A significant number of medulloblastomas (MBs) originate from abnormal activation of the sonic hedgehog/patched (SHH/PTC) signaling pathway. Although p53 deficiency enhances tumor formation in mice, inactivation of the p53 gene is seen in a minority of MBs. Wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1) downregulates p53 expression and has been shown to be overexpressed in MBs. We tested the hypothesis that overexpression of WIP1 enhances tumor formation in an SHH-dependent model of MB. We used the RCAS/Ntv-a system to study the effect of WIP1 in vitro and in vivo. We transfected A375-TVA cells with RCAS-WIP1 and then exposed these cells to cisplatin to determine the effect on p53 expression. We modeled ectopic WIP1 expression independently and in combination with SHH in the cerebella of newborn mice to assess the effect on tumor formation. Mice were observed for 12 weeks or until neurological symptoms developed. The brains were examined for tumor formation. A375-TVA cells infected with RCAS-WIP1 demonstrated reduced p53 expression after exposure to cisplatin compared with controls. We detected tumors in 12 of 35 mice (34%) injected with RCAS-WIP1 and RCAS-SHH. Tumors were detected in 3 of 40 mice (8%) injected with RCAS-SHH alone. The difference in tumor formation rates was significant (χ(2) test, P = < .01). Tumors did not form in mice injected with RCAS-WIP1 alone. We show that ectopic expression of WIP1 cooperates with SHH to enhance formation of MB, although it is insufficient to induce tumors independently. Our results verify the role of WIP1 in MB formation and provide a crucial link to the inactivation of p53 in MBs.",Tiffany A TA;Yuhui Y;Carolyn C;John Y H JY;Adrian A;Paul D PD;Michael D MD;Daniel W DW;Ganesh G
22027695,A polymeric nanoparticle encapsulated small-molecule inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling (NanoHHI) bypasses secondary mutational resistance to Smoothened antagonists.,"Aberrant activation of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is one of the most prevalent abnormalities in human cancer. Tumors with cell autonomous Hh activation (e.g., medulloblastomas) can acquire secondary mutations at the Smoothened (Smo) antagonist binding pocket, which render them refractory to conventional Hh inhibitors. A class of Hh pathway inhibitors (HPI) has been identified that block signaling downstream of Smo; one of these compounds, HPI-1, is a potent antagonist of the Hh transcription factor Gli1 and functions independent of upstream components in the pathway. Systemic administration of HPI-1 is challenging due to its minimal aqueous solubility and poor bioavailability. We engineered a polymeric nanoparticle from [poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid); (PLGA)] conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), encapsulating HPI-1 (NanoHHI). NanoHHI particles have an average diameter of approximately 60 nm, forms uniform aqueous suspension, and improved systemic bioavailability compared with the parent compound. In contrast to the prototype targeted Smo antagonist, HhAntag (Genentech), NanoHHI markedly inhibits the growth of allografts derived from Ptch(-/+); Trp53(-/-) mouse medulloblastomas that harbor a Smo(D477G) binding site mutation (P < 0.001), which is accompanied by significant downregulation of mGli1 as well as bona fide Hh target genes (Akna, Cltb, and Olig2). Notably, NanoHHI combined with gemcitabine also significantly impedes the growth of orthotopic Pa03C pancreatic cancer xenografts that have a ligand-dependent, paracrine mechanism of Hh activation when compared with gemcitabine alone. No demonstrable hematologic or biochemical abnormalities were observed with NanoHHI administration. NanoHHI should be amenable to clinical translation in settings where tumors acquire mutational resistance to current Smo antagonists.",Venugopal V;Chaoxin C;Dipankar D;Blake T BT;Collins C;Nathaniel R NR;Seung-Mo SM;Ming M;Michelle A MA;Saeed R SR;Charles M CM;Anirban A
22020042,Intact INI1 gene region with paradoxical loss of protein expression in AT/RT: implications for a possible novel mechanism associated with absence of INI1 protein immunoreactivity.,"Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is a highly malignant central nervous system tumor often misdiagnosed as some other type of pediatric embryonal tumor, such as medulloblastoma (MB). Distinguishing AT/RT from primitive neuroectodermal tumor/MB is of clinical significance, as the reported survival rate of patients with AT/RT is much lower than that of patients with average-risk primitive neuroectodermal tumor/MB. The diagnosis of AT/RT currently relies primarily on the morphologic assessment and immunostaining of a few known markers, such as the lack of INI1 protein expression. Immunohistochemical staining of INI1 is considered very sensitive and is highly specific for the detection of INI1 genetic defects. Genetic studies have shown that deletion or mutation of the INI1 gene, which is located on 22q11.2, occurs in AT/RT lesions. During our gene expression microarray analysis, we unexpectedly found a subgroup of AT/RT patients still expressing INI1 mRNA, even though INI1 proteins were negative by immunohistochemistry in those cases. Direct DNA sequencing showed no INI1 sequence alternation in 3 of 4 AT/RTs. Point mutation was found in only 1 allele of the fourth case, which would result in a frameshift mutation and generate a new INI1 protein with an extra 100-aa tail. Global array comparative genomic hybridization analysis confirmed no aberration around the INI1 gene at 22q11.2. It also extended our knowledge on the chromosomal aberration situations in our series. This study reveals that a novel yet unidentified posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism(s) for INI1 protein synthesis exists in AT/RT tumor cells.",Chan-Yen CY;Tai-Tong TT;Yu-Hsiu YH;Meng-En ME;Shih-Chieh SC;Da-Jung DJ;Muh-Lii ML;Hsei-Wei HW;Donald Ming-Tak DM
22009941,Somatic mutations in the chromatin remodeling gene ARID1A occur in several tumor types.,"Mutations in the chromatin remodeling gene ARID1A have recently been identified in the majority of ovarian clear cell carcinomas (OCCCs). To determine the prevalence of mutations in other tumor types, we evaluated 759 malignant neoplasms including those of the pancreas, breast, colon, stomach, lung, prostate, brain, and blood (leukemias). We identified truncating mutations in 6% of the neoplasms studied; nontruncating somatic mutations were identified in an additional 0.4% of neoplasms. Mutations were most commonly found in gastrointestinal samples with 12 of 119 (10%) colorectal and 10 of 100 (10%) gastric neoplasms, respectively, harboring changes. More than half of the mutated colorectal and gastric cancers displayed microsatellite instability (MSI) and the mutations in these tumors were out-of-frame insertions or deletions at mononucleotide repeats. Mutations were also identified in 2-8% of tumors of the pancreas, breast, brain (medulloblastomas), prostate, and lung, and none of these tumors displayed MSI. These findings suggest that the aberrant chromatin remodeling consequent to ARID1A inactivation contributes to a variety of different types of neoplasms.",Siân S;Meng M;D Williams DW;Xiaosong X;Jelle J;Petra P;Marjanka K MK;Sanford S;Hai H;Darell D;Ralph H RH;James R JR;Christine A CA;Michael M;Anirban A;Sami N SN;Steve S;Bert B;Kenneth W KW;Victor E VE;Nickolas N

21989342,Claudin-6 is a nonspecific marker for malignant rhabdoid and other pediatric tumors.,"Claudins are tight junction proteins with claudin-6 (CLDN6) expression mostly restricted to embryonic and fetal life. Previously reported gene expression microarray analysis showed an increased level of CLDN6 in atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) compared with other central nervous system (CNS) tumors and sarcomas. However, there exist conflicting data on expression of CLDN6 as assessed by immunohistochemistry in CNS tumors. We established membranous staining as a specific and reproducible method for evaluating CLDN6 expression based on fetal and adolescent controls. We then evaluated a large group (257) of pediatric tumors using tissue microarrays, including: 47 malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs), (31 AT/RTs and 16 non-CNS MRTs); 67 small, round, blue cell tumors (10 Wilms tumors, 10 embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, 10 neuroblastomas (NBs), 10 synovial sarcomas (SSs), 9 hepatoblastomas (HBs), 9 alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, and 9 Ewings sarcomas); and 143 CNS tumors (24 medulloblastomas, 21 pilocytic astrocytomas, 14 astrocytomas grade II/III, 13 gangliogliomas, 12 glioblastomas, 12 ependymal tumors, 11 choroid plexus tumors, 10 meningiomas, 8 dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, 8 oligodendrogliomas, 4 craniopharyngiomas, 2 germinomas, 2 primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), and 2 central neurocytomas). CLDN6 expression was seen in 12 of 31 (39%) AT/RTs, 7 of 16 (44%) non-CNS MRTs, 5 of 10 (50%) Wilms tumors, 1 of 9 (11%) HBs, 2 of 2 (100%) germinomas, 1 of 2 (50%) CNS PNETs, 1 of 24 (4%) medulloblastomas, and 1 of 10 (10%) meningiomas. Ten of 11 (91%) choroid plexus tumors showed apical staining but no concentric membranous staining. Although CLDN6 is expressed in both AT/RTs and MRTs, it is not a specific biomarker as it is expressed in a variety of other pediatric CNS and soft tissue tumors.",Lisa M LM;Theresa T;Paul P;Daniel D;Mariarita M;Jaclyn A JA;Bruce R BR;Alexander R AR
21979893,Novel amplifications in pediatric medulloblastoma identified by genome-wide copy number profiling.,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is a WHO grade IV, invasive embryonal CNS tumor that mainly affects children. The aggressiveness and response to therapy can vary considerably between cases, and despite treatment, ~30% of patients die within 2 years from diagnosis. Furthermore, the majority of survivors suffer long-term side-effects due to severe management modalities. Several distinct morphological features have been associated with differences in biological behavior, but improved molecular-based criteria that better reflect the underlying tumor biology are in great demand. In this study, we profiled a series of 25 MB with a 32K BAC array covering 99% of the current assembly of the human genome for the identification of genetic copy number alterations possibly important in MB. Previously known aberrations as well as several novel focally amplified loci could be identified. As expected, the most frequently observed alteration was the combination of 17p loss and 17q gain, which was detected in both high- and standard-risk patients. We also defined minimal overlapping regions of aberrations, including 16 regions of gain and 18 regions of loss in various chromosomes. A few noteworthy narrow amplified loci were identified on autosomes 1 (38.89-41.97 and 84.89-90.76 Mb), 3 (27.64-28.20 and 35.80-43.50 Mb), and 8 (119.66-139.79 Mb), aberrations that were verified with an alternative platform (Illumina 610Q chips). Gene expression levels were also established for these samples using Affymetrix U133Plus2.0 arrays. Several interesting genes encompassed within the amplified regions and presenting with transcript upregulation were identified. These data contribute to the characterization of this malignant childhood brain tumor and confirm its genetic heterogeneity.",Helena H;Susan S;Pelle P;Johanna J;Svetlana S;Bo B;Irina I;Monica M;Teresita T

Leptomeningeal dissemination and distant metastasis have been associated with medulloblastoma, but intramedullary metastases are very rare. CSF cytology and contrast-enhanced MRI are the main modalities used to diagnose leptomeningeal dissemination. However, intramedullary metastases are best picked up with contrast-enhanced axial sequences on MR imaging. In this report, a patient with medulloblastoma who developed intramedullary metastasis is described. The role of imaging and CSF cytology in diagnosing the spread along the CSF pathways is reviewed.

21964830,OTX2 directly activates cell cycle genes and inhibits differentiation in medulloblastoma cells.,"The transcription factor OTX2 has been implicated as an oncogene in medulloblastoma, which is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. It is highly expressed in most medulloblastomas and amplified in a subset of them. To study the role OTX2 has in medulloblastoma we investigated the downstream pathway of OTX2. We generated D425 medulloblastoma cells in which endogenous OTX2 can be silenced by inducible shRNA. Silencing of OTX2 strongly inhibited cell proliferation and resulted in a neuronal-like differentiation. Expression profiling of time courses after silencing showed a progressive change in gene expression for many cellular processes. Downregulated genes were highly enriched for cell cycle and visual perception genes, while upregulated genes were enriched for genes involved in development and differentiation. This shift is reminiscent of expression changes described during normal cerebellum development where proliferating granule progenitor cells have high OTX2 expression, which diminishes when these cells exit the cell cycle and start to differentiate. ChIP-on-chip analyses of OTX2 in D425 cells identified cell cycle and perception genes as direct OTX2 targets, while regulation of most differentiation genes appeared to be indirect. The expression of many directly regulated genes correlated to OTX2 expression in primary tumors, suggesting the in vivo relevance of these genes and their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention. These analyses provide more insight in the molecular network of OTX2, demonstrating that OTX2 is essential in medulloblastoma and directly drives proliferation by regulation of cell cycle genes.",Jens J;Nancy E NE;Danny A DA;Mohamed M;Jan J;Rogier R;Marcel M
21954036,Prospective diagnostic performance evaluation of single-voxel 1H MRS for typing and grading of brain tumours.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether single-voxel (1)H MRS could add useful information to conventional MRI in the preoperative characterisation of the type and grade of brain tumours. MRI and MRS examinations from a prospective cohort of 40 consecutive patients were analysed double blind by radiologists and spectroscopists before the histological diagnosis was known. The spectroscopists had only the MR spectra, whereas the radiologists had both the MR images and basic clinical details (age, sex and presenting symptoms). Then, the radiologists and spectroscopists exchanged their predictions and re-evaluated their initial opinions, taking into account the new evidence. Spectroscopists used four different systems of analysis for (1)H MRS data, and the efficacy of each of these methods was also evaluated. Information extracted from (1)H MRS significantly improved the radiologists' MRI-based characterisation of grade IV tumours (glioblastomas, metastases, medulloblastomas and lymphomas) in the cohort [area under the curve (AUC) in the MRI re-evaluation 0.93 versus AUC in the MRI evaluation 0.85], and also of the less malignant glial tumours (AUC in the MRI re-evaluation 0.93 versus AUC in the MRI evaluation 0.81). One of the MRS analysis systems used, the INTERPRET (International Network for Pattern Recognition of Tumours Using Magnetic Resonance) decision support system, outperformed the others, as well as being better than the MRI evaluation for the characterisation of grade III astrocytomas. Thus, preoperative MRS data improve the radiologists' performance in diagnosing grade IV tumours and, for those of grade II-III, MRS data help them to recognise the glial lineage. Even in cases in which their diagnoses were not improved, the provision of MRS data to the radiologists had no negative influence on their predictions.",Margarida M;Indira I;Carles C;Ana Paula AP;Marta M;Mònica M;Carles C;Juan José JJ;John R JR;Carles C
21953324,Relapsing tumefactive lesion in an adult with medulloblastoma previously treated with chemoradiotherapy and stem cell transplant.,"Herein, we present an adult case of medulloblastoma who received chemotherapy, radiation therapy and stem cell transplantation, and underwent multiple surgical resections for what were thought to be recurrences; however pathology confirmed a diagnosis of relapsing tumefactive lesions. This phenomenon seems to be a consequence of stem cell transplantation rather than a simple radiation treatment effect.",Ali A;Yan Y;Denis D;Maria M;Ryan Y RY;Marlon M;Sandro S;Santosh S
21945170,Bowel sparing in pediatric cranio-spinal radiotherapy: a comparison of combined electron and photon and helical TomoTherapy techniques to a standard photon method.,"The aim of this study was to compare the dose to organs at risk (OARs) from different craniospinal radiotherapy treatment approaches available at the Northern Centre for Cancer Care (NCCC), with a particular emphasis on sparing the bowel. Treatment plans were produced for a pediatric medulloblastoma patient with inflammatory bowel disease using 3D conformal 6-MV photons (3DCP), combined 3D 6-MV photons and 18-MeV electrons (3DPE), and helical photon TomoTherapy (HT). The 3DPE plan was a modification of the standard 3DCP technique, using electrons to treat the spine inferior to the level of the diaphragm. The plans were compared in terms of the dose-volume data to OARs and the nontumor integral dose. The 3DPE plan was found to give the lowest dose to the bowel and the lowest nontumor integral dose of the 3 techniques. However, the coverage of the spine planning target volume (PTV) was least homogeneous using this technique, with only 74.6% of the PTV covered by 95% of the prescribed dose. HT was able to achieve the best coverage of the PTVs (99.0% of the whole-brain PTV and 93.1% of the spine PTV received 95% of the prescribed dose), but delivered a significantly higher integral dose. HT was able to spare the heart, thyroid, and eyes better than the linac-based techniques, but other OARs received a higher dose. Use of electrons was the best method for reducing the dose to the bowel and the integral dose, at the expense of compromised spine PTV coverage. For some patients, HT may be a viable method of improving dose homogeneity and reducing selected OAR doses.",Elizabeth E;Joanne J
21940415,JC virus granule cell neuronopathy is associated with VP1 C terminus mutants.,"The polyomavirus JC (JCV) infects glial cells and causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). We described a novel JCV-variant with a 10 bp deletion in the C terminus of the VP1 capsid protein, JCV(GCN1). This mutant was associated with lytic infection of cerebellar granule cell neurons and cerebellar atrophy in an human immunodeficiency virus/PML patient. This condition, also observed independently from PML, was named JCV granule cell neuronopathy (JCV GCN). We characterized JCV mutations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of four other JCV GCN patients, and reviewed the literature on 10 reported cases. The strain from one patient harboured the identical GCN1-deletion, while the other patients had novel mutations in the same area, named JCV(GCN2-4), causing variable changes in VP1 structure. One patient also had wild-type JCV in the CSF. To study the mechanisms leading to JCV GCN, we compared viral replication kinetics from JCV(GCN1) with the prototype JCV(Mad1), the PML isolate JCV(HWM) and the prototype JCV(Mad1D) engineered with the GCN1-deletion. While all strains replicated at low levels in the medulloblastoma cell line DAOY from a cerebellar neuronal tumour, JCV(Mad1) replicated better in astroglial SVG cells than JCV(Mad1D) or JCV(GCN1) and all strains replicated at higher levels in COS-7 kidney cells, suggesting that the GCN1-deletion confers a disadvantage for viral growth in central nervous system white matter. The GCN1-deletion remained stable after 100 days in culture and VP1 protein was produced in all cell lines, indicating that JCV(GCN1) is replication-competent in vitro. These data highlight an important and previously overlooked aspect of JCV-pathogenesis. Detection of GCN-type JCV strains in CSF may help clinicians diagnose JCV GCN.",Xin X;Jose E JE;Augusto C AC;David M DM;Susan S;Jonathan H JH;Long H LH;Igor J IJ
21918916,Discrimination of paediatric brain tumours using apparent diffusion coefficient histograms.,"To determine if histograms of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) can be used to differentiate paediatric brain tumours. Imaging of histologically confirmed tumours with pre-operative ADC maps were reviewed (54 cases, 32 male, mean age 6.1 years; range 0.1-15.8 years) comprising 6 groups. Whole tumour ADC histograms were calculated; normalised for volume. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to differentiate tumour types using histogram metrics, initially for all groups and then for specific subsets. All 6 groups (5 dysembryoplastic neuroectodermal tumours, 22 primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET), 5 ependymomas, 7 choroid plexus papillomas, 4 atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumours (ATRT) and 9 juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas (JPA)) were compared. 74% (40/54) were correctly classified using logistic regression of ADC histogram parameters. In the analysis of posterior fossa tumours, 80% of ependymomas, 100% of astrocytomas and 94% of PNET-medulloblastoma were classified correctly. All PNETs were discriminated from ATRTs (22 PNET and 4 supratentorial ATRTs) (100%). ADC histograms are useful in differentiating paediatric brain tumours, in particular, the common posterior fossa tumours of childhood. PNETs were differentiated from supratentorial ATRTs, in all cases, which has important implications in terms of clinical management. Key Points • MR based apparent diffusion coefficient histograms can help differentiate paediatric brain tumours • ADC histogram parameters correctly classified the great majority of posterior fossa tumours.",Jonathan G JG;Dawn E DE;Christopher A CA
21889223,Oncologists' view of informed consent and shared decision making in paediatric radiation oncology.,"Cure rates of paediatric malignancies have dramatically improved with therapy intensification, at the cost of late treatment side effects. A survey was developed, centred around medulloblastoma scenarios, in order to explore paediatric oncology physicians' views on discussing late effects and involving parents in treatment decisions. Participants were 59 paediatric radiation and medical oncologists or fellows from USA (22), Canada (18), Europe (16), Australia (2), and Asia (1). Ninety-five percent of respondents indicated late effects discussion prior to multimodality treatment was important. Of those who supported it, 100%, 83%, 64%, and 48% thought discussing cognitive impairment, infertility, stroke, and seizures as potential late effects was important, respectively. Only 71% of respondents believed parents should be involved in treatment decisions, which did not significantly vary by respondent age, country, specialty, gender, or years in practice. The majority of oncologists who treat children believe discussing late effects with parents is important. However, there is mixed opinion on which late effects should be discussed and whether parents should be involved in deciding which treatments should be pursued. Research into perceived barriers to shared decision making and effective methods of improving the informed consent process in paediatric malignancies is needed.",Robert A RA;Mary Ann MA;Anita A;Karen J KJ
21882258,Loss of Trp53 promotes medulloblastoma development but not skin tumorigenesis in Sufu heterozygous mutant mice.,"Basal cell carcinoma of the skin typically carries genetic alterations in components of the hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway. Previously, we generated a knockout mouse with a loss-of-function mutation in suppressor of fused (Sufu), an essential repressor of the pathway downstream of Hh ligand cell surface reception. Mice heterozygous for the mutated Sufu allele develop a skin phenotype that includes lesions similar to basaloid follicular hamartomas. The purpose of the current study was to test the possibility that the simultaneous loss of the tumor suppressor gene, transformation related protein 53 (Trp53), would aggravate the Sufu skin phenotype since Trp53 loss is known to enhance the growth of other Hh-driven tumors. Consistent with previous reports, medulloblastomas and rhabdomyosarcomas developed in Sufu(+/-) ;Trp53(-/-) mice. However, the characteristic Sufu(+/-) skin phenotype was not altered in the absence of Trp53, and showed no changes in latency, multiplicity, cellular phenotype, or proliferative capacity of the basaloid lesions. This finding was both novel and intriguing and demonstrated a differential, tissue-specific sensitivity to Sufu and Trp53 tumor suppressor gene loss, which may be linked to developmental stage and the degree of proliferative activity in specific cell types.",Karin K;Asa A;Björn B;Rune R;Stephan S
21874383,Adult medulloblastoma: multiagent chemotherapy with cisplatinum and etoposide: a single institutional experience.,"In 1991, a prospective phase II trial was initiated to evaluate the efficacy of treatment for adults with medulloblastoma (MB). After surgery, patients were staged with a neuroradiologic examination of the brain and neuroaxis and by cerebrospinal fluid cytology. All patients received three cycles of upfront cisplatinum (cisplatinum) and etoposide (VP16) chemotherapy followed by cranio-spinal radiation therapy. The current article reports on the long-term results from that trial. After a median follow-up of 14.9 years, among a total of 28 adults with MB, the overall progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates at 5 years were 57.6 and 80%, respectively. The median OS for the whole group of patients was 11.3 years. The observed toxicity was mainly hematological, with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (16% of grades 3 and 4). In summary, in our small series of patients, the role of combination administration of CDDP + VP16 started before the initiation of radiotherapy in reducing recurrences, particularly distant recurrences, remains unclear. To know whether adding chemotherapy to craniospinal radiation in adult therapy increases relapse-free and overall survival, we must await the results of a larger randomized controlled clinical trial.",A A;P P;E E;A A;F F;A A;P P;L L;I I;A A;B B;A A
21874045,Oncogenic YAP promotes radioresistance and genomic instability in medulloblastoma through IGF2-mediated Akt activation.,"Radiation therapy remains the standard of care for many cancers, including the malignant pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma. Radiation leads to long-term side effects, whereas radioresistance contributes to tumor recurrence. Radio-resistant medulloblastoma cells occupy the perivascular niche. They express Yes-associated protein (YAP), a Sonic hedgehog (Shh) target markedly elevated in Shh-driven medulloblastomas. Here we report that YAP accelerates tumor growth and confers radioresistance, promoting ongoing proliferation after radiation. YAP activity enables cells to enter mitosis with un-repaired DNA through driving insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) expression and Akt activation, resulting in ATM/Chk2 inactivation and abrogation of cell cycle checkpoints. Our results establish a central role for YAP in counteracting radiation-based therapies and driving genomic instability, and indicate the YAP/IGF2/Akt axis as a therapeutic target in medulloblastoma.",A A;M M;P P;A A;E C EC;M D MD;Z Z;A M AM
21866330,Temozolomide in relapsed pediatric brain tumors: 14 cases from a single center.,"Temozolomide is an active drug against gliomas in adults. It also has some promising effects in pediatric patients with brain tumors. We have conducted a retrospective study to investigate the effectiveness of temozolomide in patients with relapsed brain tumors. The files of 14 children treated at our hospital between 2005 and 2010 with the diagnoses of relapsed brain tumors were reviewed for pathological characteristics, treatment results, and outcomes. The median age at relapse was 8 years (range, 1.08-23; F/M, 5/9). Diagnoses included medulloblastoma (n = 5), atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (n = 2), ependymoma (n = 2), glioneuronal tumor (n = 1), malignant neoplasm (n = 1), pontine glioma (n = 1), astrocytoma grade III (n = 1), and glioblastoma multiforme (n = 1). All patients except the one with pontine glioma had undergone surgical resection, and all had prior adjuvant chemotherapy. Twelve out of 14 patients had received radiotherapy. The median number of temozolomide courses was 5.0 (range, 1-24). Objective response rate in our patients was 35.7% (three complete responses, one partial response, and one minor response). Stable disease achieved in 14.3% of patients and 50% had progressive disease. Median survival time was 8 months (range, 1-55). At the end of the study, three patients were alive. Hematological toxicity was seen in 30.8% of all courses. Relapsed brain tumors in childhood have an unfavorable prognosis. These data suggest that temozolomide might be an active agent against recurrent medulloblastoma. Although overall objective response rate was low, further multicentric studies with temozolomide may be warranted in children with recurrent brain tumors.",Canan C;Haci Ahmet HA;Ali A;Bilgehan B;Tezer T;Münevver M
21850537,Expression profile of frizzled receptors in human medulloblastomas.,"Secreted WNT proteins signal through ten receptors of the frizzled (FZD) family. Because of the relevance of the WNT/β-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling pathway in medulloblastomas (MBs), we investigated the expression of all ten members of the FZD gene family (FZD1-10) in 17 human MBs, four MB cell lines and in normal human cerebellum, using real-time PCR. We found that FZD2 transcript was over-expressed in all MBs and MB cell lines. Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of FZD2 at the protein level. Moreover, the levels of FZD2 transcript were found to correlate with those of ASPM transcript, a marker of mitosis essential for mitotic spindle function. Accordingly, ASPM mRNA was expressed at a very low level in the adult, post-mitotic, human cerebellum, at higher levels in fetal cerebellum and at highest levels in MB tissues and cell lines. Unlike FZD2, the other FZDs were overexpressed (e.g., FZD1, FZD3 and FZD8) or underexpressed (e.g., FZD7, FZD9 and FZD10) in a case-restricted manner. Interestingly, we did not find any nuclear immuno-reactivity to CTNNB1 in four MBs over-expressing both FZD2 and other FZD receptors, confirming the lack of nuclear CTNNB1 staining in the presence of increased FZD expression, as in other tumor types. Overall, our results indicate that altered expression of FZD2 might be associated with a proliferative status, thus playing a role in the biology of human MBs, and possibly of cerebellar progenitors from which these malignancies arise.",Ettore E;Rosina R;Miriam M;Francesca F;Emanuela E;Bianca B;Carlo Lazzaro CL;Luca L;Gaetano G
21842312,Modulation of pediatric brain tumor autophagy and chemosensitivity.,"Brain and spinal tumors are the second most common malignancies in childhood after leukemia, and they remain the leading cause of death from childhood cancer. Autophagy is a catabolic cellular process that is thought to regulate chemosensitivity, however its role in pediatric tumors is unknown. Here we present studies in pediatric medulloblastoma cell lines (DAOY, ONS76) and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor cell lines (BT-16, BT-12) to test this role. Autophagy was inhibited using siRNA against autophagy-related genes ATG12 and ATG7 or pharmacologically induced or inhibited using rapamycin and chloroquine to test the effect of autophagy on chemosensitivity. Autophagic flux was measured using Western blot analysis of LC3-II and p62 and cell viability was determined using MTS assays and clonogenic growth. We found that when pediatric brain tumor cells under starvation stress, exposed to known autophagy inducers such as rapamycin, or treated with current chemotherapeutics (lomustine, cisplatin), all stimulate autophagy. Silencing ATG12 and ATG7 or exposure to a known autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine, could inhibit this autophagy increase; however, the effect of autophagy on tumor cell killing was small. These results may have clinical relevance in the future planning of therapeutic regimens for pediatric brain tumors.",Jean M Mulcahy JM;Andrew A
21838720,Intraoperative squash cytology: accuracy and impact on immediate surgical management of central nervous system tumours.,"To assess the diagnostic accuracy of squash cytology, reasons for deferment, disagreement and partial agreement, and assess its impact on immediate surgical management of central nervous system tumours. All cases of squash cytology received from January 2007 to July 2010 were reviewed and correlated with final histopathological diagnoses. Deferments, disagreements and partial disagreements were reviewed to look for possible reasons. The impact of disagreements and partial agreements on immediate surgical management was evaluated in consultation with neurosurgeons. Overall accuracy (including complete and partial agreement) for squash smear diagnosis of 334 cases was 94.9% while complete agreement was 79.9%, excluding deferred cases. Disagreement was seen in 17 cases and 31 cases were deferred for final histopathology diagnosis. Good correlation was seen in astrocytoma, meningioma, schwannoma, medulloblastoma, pituitary adenoma and metastatic carcinoma, whereas poor correlation was seen in oligodendroglioma, ependymoma and lymphoma. Among 17 cases with disagreement and 50 cases with partial agreement, an adverse impact on immediate surgical management was found in six (35.3%) cases and one (2.0%) case, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of squash for diagnosis of neoplastic lesions were 98.7% and 87.5%, respectively. Squash cytology is a rapid, reliable, simple technique for intraoperative consultation in neurosurgical practice with high overall accuracy. Causes causing an adverse impact on surgical management were rare and potential avoidable reasons for them were identified.",N N;N N;S S;C C;P P
21837678,Relative survival of childhood and adult medulloblastomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs).,"Medulloblastomas are 1 of the most common brain tumors in children but can affect individuals of all ages. For this report, the author investigated the impact of medulloblastomas/primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) on the US population with a focus on age differences. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were used to describe cumulative relative survival (CRS) using crude, period, and longitudinal period approaches for patients diagnosed with all medulloblastoma subtypes and PNETs. CRS estimates were obtained using SEER expected mortality data and the Ederer II method for expected survival estimation. These data were applied to the construction of rational follow-up scheduling protocols. The 5-year period CRS for all patients who were followed between 2001 and 2006 was 69%. Adults had a worse overall prognosis, but this difference in excess hazard rates appeared only after 4 years of follow-up. Furthermore, the 5-year and 10-year CRS has improved a minimum of 11% in children, adolescents, and adults over the past 25 years. The survival difference between children, adolescents, and adults with medulloblastomas and PNETs depended on the length of follow-up, which was described in this report as an age-by-follow-up interaction and observed as a ""fork"" on Kaplan-Meier curves. Differences in survival between children and adults emerged only 4 years after diagnosis, and adults fared worse. There has been significant improvement in survival from medulloblastomas/PNETs since the late 1970s and early 1980s.",Nicolas R NR
21811893,A clinicopathological study of diagnostically challenging meningioma mimics.,"The occurrence of neoplastic and nonneoplastic dural based masses that mimic meningiomas is infrequent and may not be considered during radiological and intraoperative analysis. We describe single institute study of 20 such rare cases. This study included total of 20 cases of meningioma mimics. The clinical, radiological and histopathological findings were evaluated. Tissue fixed in 10% formalin was routinely processed and 5 μ thick sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin & eosin. Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry using avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase method was done wherever indicated. In the present study group, 15 were male and 5 female with a male: female ratio of 3:1. The age ranged from 14 to 78 years. Radiologically all these lesions were extra-axial in location, predominantly hypointense on T2W, isointense on T1W images and showed intense homogenous enhancement on contrast administration. Four cases were in pediatric age group with histopathological diagnosis of Rosai Dorfman disease, medulloblastoma, hemangiopericytoma and malignant melanoma. In the adult population, the histopathological diagnoses were hemangiopericytoma, undifferentiated sarcoma, extraskeletal osteosarcoma, Rosai Dorfman disease, medulloblastoma, and metastases from systemic malignancies. Of the total 6 cases of metastases 1 was nonseminomatous germ cell tumor from a primary in testis, 1 was adenocarcinoma from an unknown primary, and 4 were adenocarcinoma from lung. There was a single case of dural based frontal lobe malignant melanoma with congenital hairy nevi on anterior chest wall, scalp, anterior abdominal wall and inguinal region. As the management and biologic behaviour of many of the MM are different, it is essential to familiarize ourselves to them.",Nandita N;Ravi R;Kanchan K;Sunil V SV;A S AS
21805473,Survival of European patients with central nervous system tumors.,"We present estimates of population-based 5-year relative survival for adult Europeans diagnosed with central nervous system tumors, by morphology (14 categories based on cell lineage and malignancy grade), sex, age at diagnosis and region (UK and Ireland, Northern, Central, Eastern and Southern Europe) for the most recent period with available data (2000-2002). Sources were 39 EUROCARE cancer registries with continuous data from 1996 to 2002. Survival time trends (1988 to 2002) were estimated from 24 cancer registries with continuous data from 1988. Overall 5-year relative survival was 85.0% for benign, 19.9% for malignant tumors. Benign tumor survival ranged from 90.6% (Northern Europe) to 77.4% (UK and Ireland); for malignant tumors the range was 25.1% (Northern Europe) to 15.6% (UK and Ireland). Survival decreased with age at diagnosis and was slightly better for women (malignant tumors only). For glial tumors, survival varied from 83.5% (ependymoma and choroid plexus) to 2.7% (glioblastoma); and for non-glioma tumors from 96.5% (neurinoma) to 44.9% (primitive neuroectoderm tumor/medulloblastoma). Survival differences between regions narrowed after adjustment for morphology and age, and were mainly attributable to differences in morphology mix; however UK and Ireland and Eastern Europe patients still had 40% and 30% higher excess risk of death, respectively, than Northern Europe patients (reference). Survival for benign tumors increased from 69.3% (1988-1990) to 77.1% (2000-2002); but survival for malignant tumors did not improve indicating no useful advances in treatment over the 14-year study period, notwithstanding major improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of other solid cancers.",Milena M;Pamela P;Susanna S;Tom T;Rafael R;Silvia S; 
21805324,The role of radiotherapy in adult medulloblastoma: long-term single-institution experience and a review of the literature.,"Medulloblastoma (MB) occurs infrequently in adult patients and standard treatment is still controversial. We report our long-term, single-institution experience of adult MB and a review of the literature. We analysed adult patients with histologically proved MB treated by postoperative radiotherapy. Primary endpoints were local control (LC), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Acute toxicity was reported according to CTC-NCI score vers. 3.0 and specific neuropsychological assessment analysis was performed to define late brain toxicity. From 1990-2008, 13 patients were treated by craniospinal (CSI, 12/13) or cranial irradiation (1/13, because of bad clinical conditions). Median follow up was 101 months (64-218). Complete radiological response was observed in 12/13 patients and a partial response in 1/13. Ten-year LC, OS, and DFS were 91, 76, and 84%, respectively. Two patients died because of local and spinal progression after 13 and 62 months. Acute G3 haematological toxicity (RTOG score) was observed for one patient only. The neuropsychological analysis did not reveal late toxicity related to brain radiotherapy. This experience confirms the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy in adult MB patients, resulting in very interesting 10-year LC and OS.",M M;S S;D D;S S;N N;A A;F F;V V;C C;V V;B B
21796767,Hearing loss among survivors of childhood brain tumors treated with an irradiation-sparing approach.,"Intensive, irradiation-sparing chemotherapy regimens for malignant brain tumors have improved survival and neurocognitive outcomes in very young children. Platinum compounds are pivotal to this approach's success but are associated with hearing loss that markedly reduces quality of life for survivors. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and severity of ototoxicity associated with Head Start and similar irradiation-sparing regimens. A retrospective cohort study was conducted of children treated for malignant brain tumors at Children's Hospital Los Angeles using irradiation-sparing regimens. Patient and treatment characteristics were ascertained. Primary outcomes were post-treatment hearing status, need for hearing aids, and hearing threshold change. Twenty-nine patients were evaluable. The most common diagnosis was medulloblastoma (n = 14). The median age at diagnosis was 2.0 years (range, 0.2-9.2). Median time from diagnosis to most recent hearing assessment was 1.1 years (mean 2.4; range, 0.2-17.5). Cumulative cisplatin and carboplatin dose was 281 ± 88 mg/m(2) and 1,205 ± 277 mg/m(2) , respectively. All patients had aminoglycoside exposure. Following treatment, 18 patients (62.1%) had abnormal hearing and 11 (37.9%) required hearing aids. At 4,000 Hz, statistically significant hearing loss was documented in the range of 30-40 dB. While eliminating cranial irradiation has dramatically improved survival and neurocognitive and neuroendocrine outcomes in this population, clinically significant hearing loss is now the leading late effect due to the necessity of platinum-based chemotherapy. Our results document the need for audiometric monitoring and developing otoprotective strategies in this vulnerable population.",Etan E;Shveta S;Lingyun L;Liora L;Stephanie S;Jonathan J;David R DR
21796446,p53 expression predicts dismal outcome for medulloblastoma patients with metastatic disease.,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant primary brain tumour in childhood. Metastatic disease (M+) at diagnosis is the most important negative prognostic clinical marker and, despite craniospinal irradiation and intensive chemotherapy, it remains one of the leading causes of treatment failure. To date, few clinical and biological data have been evaluated to obtain an additional prognostic profile for these high-risk patients. In this study, 169 patients with metastatic MB registered in the multicentre HIT2000 trial of the German Society of Pediatric Oncology and Haematology (GPOH) have been investigated to determine the importance of p53 protein expression in predicting survival. At a median follow-up of 4.1 years, 159 patients with p53-negative tumours had significantly better four-year event-free survival (EFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) (56 ± 11, 59 ± 4%) than 10 patients with p53-positive tumours (40 ± 16, 40 ± 16%; P = 0.018 for EFS, P = 0.007 for PFS, respectively). Furthermore, four-year overall survival (OS) of children with p53-negative tumours was higher than for children with p53-positive tumours (72 ± 4 vs. 35 ± 18%, P = 0.05). Three of the p53-positive MBs harbored a point mutation in the TP53 gene. p53 protein assessment by immunohistochemistry may be a useful tool for sub-stratification of metastatic high-risk MB patients.",Marco M;André O AO;Stefan S;Torsten T
21793975,Genetic alterations in microRNAs in medulloblastomas.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate a variety of cellular processes via the regulation of multiple target genes. We screened 48 medulloblastomas for mutation, deletion and amplification of nine miRNA genes that were selected on the basis of the presence of potential target sequences within the 3'-untranslated region of the MYCC mRNA. Differential PCR revealed deletions in miR-186 (15%), miR-135a-1 (33%), miR-548d-1 (42%), miR-548d-2 (21%) and miR-512-2 (33%) genes, whereas deletion or amplification was detected in miR-135b (23%) and miR-135a-2 (15%). In miR-33b, deletion, amplification or a mutation at the precursor miRNA were detected in 10% of medulloblastomas. Overall, 35/48 (73%) medulloblastomas had at least one alteration. Real-time RT-PCR revealed MYCC overexpression in 11 of 37 (30%) medulloblastomas, and there was a correlation between MYCC overexpression and miR-512-2 gene deletion (P = 0.0084). Antisense-based knockdown of miR-512-5p (mature sequence of miR-512-2) resulted in significant upregulation of MYCC expression in HeLa and A549 cells, while forced overexpression of miR-512-2 in medulloblastoma/PNET cell lines DAOY, UW-228-2, PFSK resulted in the downregulation of MYCC protein. Furthermore, the results of luciferase reporter assays suggested that miR-512-2 targets the MYCC gene. These results suggest that alterations in the miRNA genes may be an alternative mechanism leading to MYCC overexpression in medulloblastomas.",Sheng-Qing SQ;Young-Ho YH;Fiaschetti F;Tarek T;Sumihito S;Hui H;Zheng Z;Michael M;Hiroko H
21755312,Generation of cancerous neural stem cells forming glial tumor by oncogenic stimulation.,"Neural stem cells in the brain have been shown to be 'cells of origin' of certain brain cancers, most notably astrocytomas and medulloblastoma. In particular, in a mouse model, the targeting of genetic modifications for astrocytoma-relevant tumor suppressors to neural stem cells causes malignant astrocytoma to arise, thereby suggesting that astrocytoma is derived from neural stem cells. However, it remains to be determined whether this important finding is reproducible in humans. Herein, we generated cancerous neural stem cells by introducing a set of oncogenes to human fetal neural stem cells (hfNSCs). Serial genetic modification with v-myc for immortalization and consequent H-Ras for oncogenic stimulation with viral gene delivery proved sufficient to induce the transformation of hfNSCs. The resultant F3.Ras cells evidenced a variety of the hallmarks of brain cancer stem cells and most importantly were tumorigenic, forming brain cancers consisting of both a large number of differentiated and a very few undifferentiated populations of cells in an in vivo mouse model. On the contrary, oligodendrocytes derived from the v-myc expressing parent neural stem cells were not transformed by H-Ras, which suggests that neural stem cells may be more susceptible to cancerous transformation by a combination of oncogenes. We also determined that v-myc expressing fetal neural stem cells were defective in p53 response upon the introduction of H-Ras; this finding suggests that an insufficient p53-dependent tumor suppressive mechanism would be associated with high oncogenic susceptibility to H-Ras introduction.",Ji-Seon JS;Hong Jun HJ;Bo-Hyun BH;Seung-Hyun SH;Mi-Ok MO;Sung Han SH;Hyung Seok HS;Min Cheol MC;Jeong Taik JT;Albert J AJ;Seung U SU;Hyuk Jin HJ
21735115,Norcantharidin impairs medulloblastoma growth by inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.,"Medulloblastoma is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in pediatric cancer. Wnt-active tumors, an independent molecular subgroup in medulloblastoma, are characterized by a distinct pattern of genomic aberrations. We assessed the anticancer activity of cantharidin and norcantharidin against medulloblastoma, as cell lines in vitro and in athymic nude mice in vivo. Cantharidin and norcantharidin treatment impaired the growth of DAOY and UW228 medulloblastoma cells and promoted the loss of β-catenin activation and the β-catenin nuclearization linked to N-cadherin impairment in vitro. Intra-peritoneal administration of norcantharidin inhibited the growth of intra-cerebellum tumors in orthotopic xenograft nude mice. Analysis of the xenograft tissues revealed enhanced neuronal differentiation and reduced β-catenin expression. Our findings suggest that norcantharidin has potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of medulloblastoma as a result of its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and its impairment of Wnt-β-catenin signaling.",Flora F;Maria Nunzia MN;Marianeve M;Pasqualino P;Valeria Di VD;Gennaro G;Massimo M
21732818,Expression of Sonic hedgehog during cell proliferation in the human cerebellum.,"The regulation of cell proliferation in the external granular layer (EGL) of the developing cerebellum is important for its normal patterning. An important signal that regulates EGL cell proliferation is Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh is secreted by the Purkinje cells (PC) and has a mitogenic effect on the granule cell precursors of the EGL. Deregulation of Shh signaling has been associated with abnormal development, and been implicated in medulloblastomas, which are tumors that arise from the cerebellum. Given the importance of the Shh pathway in cerebellum development and disease, there has been no systematic study of its expression pattern during human cerebellum development. In this study, we describe the expression pattern of Shh, its receptor patched, smoothened, and its effectors that belong to the Gli family of transcription factors, during normal human cerebellum development from 10 weeks of gestational age, and in medulloblastomas that represents a case of abnormal cell proliferation in the cerebellum. This expression pattern is compared to equivalent stages in the normal development of cerebellum in mouse, as well as in tumors. Important differences between human and mouse that reflect differences in the normal developmental program between the 2 species are observed. First, in humans there appears to be a stage of Shh signaling within the EGL, when the PC are not yet the source of Shh. Second, unlike in the postnatal mouse cerebellum, expression of Shh in the PC in the postnatal human cerebellum is downregulated. Finally, medulloblastomas in the human but not in patched heterozygote mouse express Shh. These results highlight cross-species differences in the regulation of the Shh signaling pathway.",Parthiv P;Upasna U;Subashika S;Chitra C;Soumya S;Pierre P;Shyamala S
21725800,Expression analysis of stem cell-related genes reveal OCT4 as a predictor of poor clinical outcome in medulloblastoma.,"Aberrant expression of stem cell-related genes in tumors may confer more primitive and aggressive traits affecting clinical outcome. Here, we investigated expression and prognostic value of the neural stem cell marker CD133, as well as of the pluripotency genes LIN28 and OCT4 in 37 samples of pediatric medulloblastoma, the most common and challenging type of embryonal tumor. While most medulloblastoma samples expressed CD133 and LIN28, OCT4 expression was found to be more sporadic, with detectable levels occurring in 48% of tumors. Expression levels of OCT4, but not CD133 or LIN28, were significantly correlated with shorter survival (P ≤ 0.0001). Median survival time of patients with tumors hyperexpressing OCT4 and tumors displaying low/undetectable OCT4 expression were 6 and 153 months, respectively. More importantly, when patients were clinically stratified according to their risk of tumor recurrence, positive OCT4 expression in primary tumor specimens could discriminate patients classified as average risk but which further deceased within 5 years of diagnosis (median survival time of 28 months), a poor clinical outcome typical of high risk patients. Our findings reveal a previously unknown prognostic value for OCT4 expression status in medulloblastoma, which might be used as a further indicator of poor survival and aid postoperative treatment selection, with a particular potential benefit for clinically average risk patients.",Carolina Oliveira CO;Daniela Emi DE;Najsla N;Andréa A;Jorge Estefano Santana JE;Sérgio S;Silvia Regina Caminada SR;Oswaldo Keith OK
21720807,Growth-inhibitory effect of neurotrophin-3-secreting adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells on the D283-MED human medulloblastoma cell line.,"Medulloblastoma (MBL), the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, is incurable in about one-third of patients and can lead to long-term disabilities despite current multimodal treatments. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate in vitro biological effects of neurotrophins-3 (NT-3) on MBL cells and to evaluate the growth-inhibitory effect of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3)-secreting stem cells on tumor cells. We confirmed by western blotting that D283-MED cells express tyrosine kinase C, a specific receptor for NT-3. Analyzing the biological effects of NT-3 on MBL cells, we evaluated autophagy, apoptosis, senescence, and differentiation of tumor cells with NT-3. The NT-3 induced a concentration-dependent increase in apoptosis in the tumor cell line (P < 0.001). The high concentrations of NT-3 increased the expression of class III β-tubulin (P < 0.001) and decreased the expression of Nestin (P < 0.05). NT-3-secreting stem cells were produced by nucleofecting pIRES2.EGFP-NT3 into human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAT-MSCs) and their tropic property toward MBL cells was confirmed by migration assay. Double-layered co-culture experiments with the NT-3-secreting hAT-MSCs and D283-MED MBL cells were performed, and NT-3-induced cell death was studied by 3-(4,5-dimethylathiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dephenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Consequently, the high concentrations of NT-3-secreting hAT-MSCs significantly (P < 0.05) increased the death of D283-MED cells in vitro. The present study demonstrated that both apoptotic cell death and neuronal differentiation of tumor cells were the mechanisms of growth-inhibitory effect of NT-3-secreting hAT-MSCs on MBL cell line.",Young-Hoon YH;Seung Hee SH;Soo Jung SJ;Seung Ah SA;Ji Hoon JH;Seung-Ki SK;Kyu-Chang KC;Byung-Kyu BK;Chae-Yong CY
21685941,Sonic hedgehog regulates Bmi1 in human medulloblastoma brain tumor-initiating cells.,"Bmi1 is a key stem cell regulatory gene implicated in the pathogenesis of many aggressive cancers, including medulloblastoma. Overexpression of Bmi1 promotes cell proliferation and is required for hedgehog (Hh) pathway-driven tumorigenesis. This study aimed to determine if Sonic hedgehog (Shh) modulates the key stem cell regulatory gene Bmi1 in childhood medulloblastoma brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs). Although current literature suggests that there is a correlation between Shh pathway genes and Bmi1 expression, it is unclear whether there is indeed a direct regulatory mechanism. To address whether Shh induces expression of Bmi1, stem cell-enriched populations from medulloblastoma cell lines and primary samples were treated with Shh ligand and KAAD-cyclopamine (Shh antagonist). Our data indicate that Bmi1 expression positively correlates with increasing Shh ligand concentrations. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that Gli1 preferentially binds to the Bmi1 promoter, and Bmi1 transcript levels are increased and decreased by Gli1 overexpression and downregulation, respectively. Knockdown experiments of Bmi1 in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that Hh signaling not only drives Bmi1 expression, but a feedback mechanism exists wherein downstream effectors of Bmi1 may, in turn, activate Hh pathway genes. These findings implicate Bmi1 and Hh as mutually indispensable pathways in medulloblastoma BTIC maintenance. Recent molecular characterization of medulloblastoma also reveals that Bmi1 is overexpressed across all subgroups of medulloblastoma, particularly in the most aggressive subtypes. Lastly, despite recent identification of BTIC markers, the molecular characterization of these cell populations remains unclear. In this work, we propose that the BTIC marker CD133 may segregate a cell population with a Hh-receptor phenotype, thus demonstrating a cell-cell interaction between the CD133+ Hh receptor cells and the CD133- Hh-secreting cells.",X X;C C;B B;N N;E E;S S;T T;R R;J J;P P;M D MD;C C;S K SK
21667264,Identification of c-myc-dependent proteins in the medulloblastoma cell line D425Med.,"High c-myc levels are linked to poor prognosis in medulloblastoma (MB), and it was the aim of the current study to search for c-myc-dependent proteins in the MB cell line D425Med. For this purpose D425Med cells and cells with knocked-down c-myc (by siRNA) were analysed by a gel-based differential proteomics study using mass spectrometry. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins C1/C2, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/B, stathmin, endoplasmic reticulum protein ERp29 precursor and guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase were c-myc dependently expressed. Signalling, the protein machinery, metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum function may be affected and these results enable studying tumour tissue for these proteins as potential dignity markers or pharmacological targets.",Amedeo A AA;Lin L;Thomas T;Wei-Qiang WQ;Irene I;Gert G
21666711,Upregulation of VEGF-A and CD24 gene expression by the tGLI1 transcription factor contributes to the aggressive behavior of breast cancer cells.,"The Hedgehog signaling pathway is one of the most dysregulated pathways in human cancers. The glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) transcription factor is the terminal effector of the Hedgehog pathway, frequently activated in human breast cancer and an emerging target of breast cancer therapy. While somatic mutations in the human GLI1 gene have never been reported in any cell or tumor type, we recently uncovered the existence of a novel alternatively spliced, truncated GLI1 (tGLI1) that has an in-frame deletion of 41 codons spanning the entire exon 3 and part of exon 4 of the GLI1 gene. Using glioblastoma models, we showed that tGLI1 has gained the ability to promote glioblastoma migration and invasion via its gain-of-function transcriptional activity. However, the pathological impact of tGLI1 on breast cancer remains undefined. Here, we report that tGLI1 is frequently expressed in human breast cancer cell lines and primary specimens we have examined to date, but is undetectable in normal breast tissues. We found for the first time that tGLI1, but not GLI1, binds to and enhances the human vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) gene promoter, leading to its upregulation. Consequently, tGLI1-expressing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells secret higher levels of VEGF-A and contain a higher propensity, than the isogenic cells with control vector and GLI1, to stimulate in vitro angiogenesis of human vascular endothelial cells. We further showed that tGLI1 has gained the ability to enhance the motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells in a proliferation-independent manner and that this functional gain is associated with increased expression of migration/invasion-associated genes, CD24, MMP-2 and MMP-9. tGLI1 has also acquired the property to facilitate anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells. Collectively, our results define tGLI1 as a gain-of-function GLI1 transcription factor and a novel mediator of the behavior of clinically more aggressive breast cancer.",X X;J J;M W MW;H-W HW
21664060,Brain tumor therapy-induced changes in normal-appearing brainstem measured with longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging.,"To characterize therapy-induced changes in normal-appearing brainstems of childhood brain tumor patients by serial diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We analyzed 109 DTI studies from 20 brain tumor patients, aged 4 to 23 years, with normal-appearing brainstems included in the treatment fields. Those with medulloblastomas, supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (n = 10) received postoperative craniospinal irradiation (23.4-39.6 Gy) and a cumulative dose of 55.8 Gy to the primary site, followed by four cycles of high-dose chemotherapy. Patients with high-grade gliomas (n = 10) received erlotinib during and after irradiation (54-59.4 Gy). Parametric maps of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were computed and spatially registered to three-dimensional radiation dose data. Volumes of interest included corticospinal tracts, medial lemnisci, and the pons. Serving as an age-related benchmark for comparison, 37 DTI studies from 20 healthy volunteers, aged 6 to 25 years, were included in the analysis. The median DTI follow-up time was 3.5 years (range, 1.6-5.0 years). The median mean dose to the pons was 56 Gy (range, 7-59 Gy). Three patterns were seen in longitudinal FA and apparent diffusion coefficient changes: (1) a stable or normal developing time trend, (2) initial deviation from normal with subsequent recovery, and (3) progressive deviation without evidence of complete recovery. The maximal decline in FA often occurred 1.5 to 3.5 years after the start of radiation therapy. A full recovery time trend could be observed within 4 years. Patients with incomplete recovery often had a larger decline in FA within the first year. Radiation dose alone did not predict long-term recovery patterns. Variations existed among individual patients after therapy in longitudinal evolution of brainstem white matter injury and recovery. Early response in brainstem anisotropy may serve as an indicator of the recovery time trend over 5 years after radiation therapy.",Chiaho C;Thomas E TE;Amar A;Alberto A;Yong Y;Yimei Y;George R GR;Larry E LE;Robert J RJ
21658852,Supratentorial neurometabolic alterations in pediatric survivors of posterior fossa tumors.,"Therapy and tumor-related effects such as hypoperfusion, internal hydrocephalus, chemotherapy, and irradiation lead to significant motor and cognitive sequelae in pediatric posterior fossa tumor survivors. A distinct proportion of those factors related to the resulting late effects is hitherto poorly understood. This study aimed at separating the effects of neurotoxic factors on central nervous system metabolism by using H-1 MR spectroscopy to quantify cerebral metabolite concentrations in these patients in comparison to those in age-matched healthy peers. Fifteen patients with World Health Organization (WHO) I pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) treated by resection only, 24 patients with WHO IV medulloblastoma (MB), who additionally received chemotherapy and craniospinal irradiation, and 43 healthy peers were investigated using single-volume H-1 MR spectroscopy of parietal white matter and gray matter. Concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) were significantly decreased in white matter (p < 0.0001) and gray matter (p < 0.0001) of MB patients and in gray matter (p = 0.005) of PA patients, compared to healthy peers. Decreased creatine concentrations in parietal gray matter correlated significantly with older age at diagnosis in both patient groups (MB patients, p = 0.009, r = 0.52; PA patients, p = 0.006, r = 0.7). Longer time periods since diagnosis were associated with lower NAA levels in white matter of PA patients (p = 0.008, r = 0.66). Differently decreased NAA concentrations were observed in both PA and MB groups of posterior fossa tumor patients. We conclude that this reflects a disturbance of the neurometabolic steady state of normal-appearing brain tissue due to the tumor itself and to the impact of surgery in both patient groups. Further incremental decreases of metabolite concentrations in MB patients may point to additional harm caused by irradiation and chemotherapy. The stronger decrease of NAA in MB patients may correspond to the additional damage of combined irradiation and chemotherapy on neuroaxonal cell viability and number.",Stefan M SM;Pablo Hernáiz PH;Harald H
21615516,Diagnostic pitfall in the diagnosis of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma arising in the central nervous system.,"Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a rare aggressive neoplasm typically affecting the bones of young adults. It may also arise in somatic soft tissue, the CNS and other organs. It has a characteristic biphasic histological pattern composed of highly undifferentiated small round cells and islands of well-differentiated hyaline cartilage. We report a case of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma arising from the right tentorium cerebelli in a 21-year-old woman with symptoms relating to mass effect. Histological examination demonstrated a purely small round cell appearance in a specimen obtained during partial resection at an outside institution, leading to an erroneous diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). The diagnosis of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma was made only after tissue obtained during a definitive complete macroscopic removal involving the regional tentorium cerebelli, transverse and sigmoid dural venous sinuses which showed a prominent cartilaginous component. We discuss the features of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma arising in the CNS, the important differential diagnoses of small round-cell tumors within the CNS, and the differentiating features of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma from Ewing sarcoma/PNET, medulloblastoma, hemangiopericytoma, monophasic synovial sarcoma and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour.",Lisa L;Winny W;Mark M;Thomas T
21570213,Intensity-modulated arc therapy for pediatric posterior fossa tumors.,"To compare intensity-modulated arc therapy (IMAT) to noncoplanar intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in the treatment of pediatric posterior fossa tumors. Nine pediatric patients with posterior fossa tumors, mean age 9 years (range, 6-15 years), treated using IMRT were chosen for this comparative planning study because of their tumor location. Each patient's treatment was replanned to receive 54 Gy to the planning target volume (PTV) using five different methods: eight-field noncoplanar IMRT, single coplanar IMAT, double coplanar IMAT, single noncoplanar IMAT, and double noncoplanar IMAT. For each method, the dose to 95% of the PTV was held constant, and the doses to surrounding critical structures were minimized. The different plans were compared based on conformity, total linear accelerator dose monitor units, and dose to surrounding normal tissues, including the entire body, whole brain, temporal lobes, brainstem, and cochleae. The doses to the target and critical structures for the various IMAT methods were not statistically different in comparison with the noncoplanar IMRT plan, with the following exceptions: the cochlear doses were higher and whole brain dose was lower for coplanar IMAT plans; the cochleae and temporal lobe doses were lower and conformity increased for noncoplanar IMAT plans. The advantage of the noncoplanar IMAT plan was enhanced by doubling the treatment arc. Noncoplanar IMAT results in superior treatment plans when compared to noncoplanar IMRT for the treatment of posterior fossa tumors. IMAT should be considered alongside IMRT when treatment of this site is indicated.",Chris C;Jonathan J;Thomas E TE
21537925,Interval between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of medulloblastoma in children: distribution and determinants in a population-based study.,"Hospital-based studies have reported long delays in the diagnosis of paediatric brain tumours. Our objective was to describe the duration between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of medulloblastoma in children and study their clinical determinants in a population-based study. This retrospective cohort study included all paediatric medulloblastoma from a region of France from 1990 to 2005. The median interval from symptom onset until diagnosis for these 166 patients was 65 days and did not decrease during the study period. The most frequent manifestations were: vomiting (88%), headaches (79%), psychomotor regression (60% of children under 3 years), psychological symptoms (27%), strabismus (26%), and asthenia (25%). For one third of the children under 3 years, the diagnosis was made only after life-threatening signs of intracranial hypertension appeared. The prediagnosis interval was significantly longer (median 91 vs. 60 days, p = 0.001) in children with psychological symptoms (27%). Causes for intervals that exceeded the median (65 days) included inconsistent (25%) or late (36%) combination of headaches and vomiting, a period of spontaneous symptom remission (14%-20%), no (24%) or late (57%) neurological signs, psychological symptoms (35%), and a normal neurological examination (27%). Time to medulloblastoma diagnosis in children remains fairly long, despite advances in imaging. Primary-care physicians must be suspicious not only of suggestive neurological signs, but also of non-specific symptoms that persist or are multiple. A meticulous neurological examination and cerebral imaging for such patients might facilitate earlier diagnosis.",Jean-François JF;Martin M;François F;Brigitte B;Dominique D;Stephan S;Olivier O;Nozar N;Christian C;Stéphanie S;Jacques J
21345612,Development and evaluation of multiple isocentric volumetric modulated arc therapy technique for craniospinal axis radiotherapy planning.,"To develop and compare a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique with conventional radiotherapy for craniospinal irradiation with respect to improved dose conformity and homogeneity in the planning target volume (PTV) and to reduced dose to organs at risk (OAR). Conventional craniospinal axis radiotherapy plans of 5 patients were acquired. The median (range) length of the PTV was 58.9 (48.1-83.7) cm. The 6-MV VMAT plans were inversely planned with one isocenter near the base of the brain and the minimum number of isocenters required for the specified lengths of spine. The plans were optimized with high weighting for PTV coverage and low weighting for OAR sparing. Conformity and heterogeneity indices, dose-volume histograms, mean doses, and non-PTV integral doses from the two plans (prescription dose 23.4 Gy in 13 fractions) were compared. The median (range) conformity index of VMAT was 1.22 (1.09-1.45), compared with 1.69 (1.44-2.67) for conventional plans (p = 0.04). The median (range) heterogeneity index was also lower for VMAT compared with conventional plans: 1.04 (1.03-1.07) vs. 1.12 (1.09-1.19), respectively (p = 0.04). A significant reduction of mean and maximum doses was observed in the heart, thyroid, esophagus, optic nerves, and eyes with VMAT when compared with conventional plans. A decrease in body V(10Gy) was observed, but for 4 of 5 patients non-PTV integral dose was increased with VMAT when compared with the conventional plans. A VMAT technique to treat the craniospinal axis significantly reduces OAR dose, potentially leading to lower late organ toxicity. However, this is achieved at the expense of increased low-dose volumes, which is inherent to the technique, carrying a potentially increased risk of secondary malignancies.",Young K YK;Corrinne J CJ;James L JL;Alan P AP;Frank H FH

A significant portion of patients present with dissemination to cerebrobspinal fluid (CSF). However, a limited number of studies are available regarding the cytomorphologic findings of AT/RT in CSF. We collected eight cases of CSF cytology of AT/RT and describe the cytomorphologic features of AT/RT in CSF. Typical rhabdoid cells are found in most cases and they are characterized by eccentric nuclei, abundant cytoplasm, and clustering of the tumor cells. The presence of these cells in CSF indicates disseminated diseases and aggressive therapeutic consideration for patient management is required.",Junjeong J;Hoguen H;Se Hoon SH
21035954,"Infant brain tumors: incidence, survival, and the role of radiation based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Data.","To evaluate the incidence of infant brain tumors and survival outcomes by disease and treatment variables. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program November 2008 submission database provided age-adjusted incidence rates and individual case information for primary brain tumors diagnosed between 1973 and 2006 in infants less than 12 months of age. Between 1973 and 1986, the incidence of infant brain tumors increased from 16 to 40 cases per million (CPM), and from 1986 to 2006, the annual incidence rate averaged 35 CPM. Leading histologies by annual incidence in CPM were gliomas (13.8), medulloblastoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (6.6), and ependymomas (3.6). The annual incidence was higher in whites than in blacks (35.0 vs. 21.3 CPM). Infants with low-grade gliomas had the highest observed survival, and those with atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs) or primary rhabdoid tumors of the brain had the lowest. Between 1979 and 1993, the annual rate of cases treated with radiation within the first 4 months from diagnosis declined from 20.5 CPM to <2 CPM. For infants with medulloblastoma, desmoplastic histology and treatment with both surgery and upfront radiation were associated with improved survival, but on multivariate regression, only combined surgery and radiation remained associated with improved survival, with a hazard ratio for death of 0.17 compared with surgery alone (p = 0.005). For ATRTs, those treated with surgery and upfront radiation had a 12-month survival of 100% compared with 24.4% for those treated with surgery alone (p = 0.016). For ependymomas survival was higher in patients treated in more recent decades (p = 0.001). The incidence of infant brain tumors has been stable since 1986. Survival outcomes varied markedly by histology. For infants with medulloblastoma and ATRTs, improved survival was observed in patients treated with both surgery and early radiation compared with those treated with surgery alone.",Andrew J AJ;Mark W MW;Andrew L AL;Natia N
